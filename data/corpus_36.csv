As it will be recalled, US President Biden had announced that some US weapons were allowed to be used by Ukraine on Russian territory.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that Ukraine's use of weapons supplied by allied countries to target Russian territory is ""within the framework of the right to self-defense"" and that ""legitimate defense is not about escalating tensions.""

Stoltenberg held a press conference in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, following the NATO Foreign Ministers' Informal Meeting. Stating that no final decisions were made at the meeting with the foreign ministers, Stoltenberg said that progress was made in terms of NATO playing a larger role in providing equipment and training to Ukraine, making multi-year financial commitments, and ensuring fair burden-sharing among allies.

Highlighting that 99% of the military assistance provided to Ukraine comes from NATO allies, Stoltenberg said, ""Therefore, it makes sense for NATO to play a bigger role in these efforts. This way, we can strengthen our support using NATO structures, provide more predictability to Kyiv, and meet both urgent and long-term needs.""

Stoltenberg suggested that allies make multi-year financial commitments to Ukraine, saying, ""Allies have provided approximately 40 billion euros worth of military support to Ukraine each year. We should continue to provide support at least at this level as long as it is necessary."" Stoltenberg emphasized the importance of allies sharing the burden of assistance to Ukraine fairly, stating that this would increase accountability and provide the predictability necessary for Ukraine to make long-term plans.

Stoltenberg also mentioned that Ukraine's NATO membership was discussed, saying, ""Allies agree that Ukraine's future lies in NATO, and we are determined to make progress on this path. In a broader sense, membership will be Ukraine's ultimate security guarantee, ensuring lasting peace and providing the stability necessary for reconstruction.""

Regarding the ongoing debate about Ukraine's ability to use weapons supplied by allied countries to target Russian territory and the risk of escalating regional tensions, Stoltenberg stated, ""Russia started this war. They initiated the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II. Russia is hitting hospitals, schools, and shopping centers. Russia is bombing the electricity and water infrastructure. Russia is killing Ukrainian civilians. Ukraine is defending itself against Russia's destructive brutality. Let me be clear, legitimate defense is not about escalating tensions. Legitimate defense is a fundamental right enshrined in the United Nations Charter.""

Stoltenberg said, ""Russia has escalated tensions by opening new fronts in the Kharkiv region and launching new attacks on Ukrainian citizens. As the war grows, our overall support will continue to grow."" Stoltenberg also stated that Russia is making threats because it is uncomfortable with the support provided to Ukraine, saying, ""Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine. But we will not be deterred.""",en.haberler.com,news,Haberler.com,,0.1450980392156862,454861327,1,https://foto.haberler.com/haber/2024/05/31/stoltenberg-ukrayna-nin-muttefiklerden-aldigi-17383692_8569_o.jpg,eng-9612381

According to Shmyhal, this is ""the launch of Ukraine's membership negotiations in June, the implementation of reforms, the seizure of Russian assets, the Peace Formula, energy, and weapons.""

Shmyhal said it was important for Ukraine to be able to use the weapons of its partners for strikes inside Russia, which will help strengthen the country's ability to defend itself.

He thanked the countries that have already announced this possibility publicly.

""Another priority is artillery ammunition. I thanked the Czech Republic for the initiative. We are counting on rhythmic and continuous deliveries of shells. We also considered the topic of increasing the production of Ukrainian weapons,"" Shmyhal said.

He also emphasized the need for air defense. At least seven Patriot systems and F-16 fighter jets will significantly help protect people and critical infrastructure, Shmyhal said.

The participants in the meeting paid special attention to energy.

""I thanked [the EU ambassadors] for the provision of the necessary equipment to restore facilities. I also called [on them] to consider increasing the capacity of electricity import from 1.7 GW to 2.2 GW. This is important against the background of Russian energy terror,"" Shmyhal said.

Between 6-9 June, around 360 million people across the EU will vote for representatives from national parties to sit in the European Parliament.

The grouping or coalition with the most seats will help to shape the leadership of the next European Commission. The overall composition of parliament will also influence the bloc's priorities between 2024-2029.

Climate change and energy once again feature prominently in the manifestos of the major parties, with mounting pressure to secure energy supplies in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine drawing particular focus.

Core to this is a transition to decarbonised domestic energy. Carbon Brief's analysis shows that the relatively small nations of Portugal, Latvia and Finland have led the way since the last EU election, with the largest percentage drop in power-sector emissions between 2019 and 2023.

Malta and the Netherlands have led in increasing their renewables shares, with the Netherlands also seeing the largest absolute increase in renewable generation.

Meanwhile, fossil-fuel generation fell in all but three countries when comparing 2019 and 2023.

Other key findings from the analysis include:

In this analysis, Carbon Brief looks at how the electricity sector has changed since the last election.

Every national power system across the EU has become cleaner since the last European Parliamentary election in 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows.

Finland led the way in terms of reducing grid intensity - the measure of how clean the electricity within national grids is - halving its intensity between 2019 and 2023 to become the third cleanest in the EU, behind France and Sweden.

In absolute terms, Greece reduced its grid intensity the most since 2019, Carbon Brief shows. The country hit a new record high level of clean energy generation, with power grid operator IPTO announcing that renewables and hydroelectric plants accounted for 57% of the country' energy in 2023.

Germany saw the largest fall in power-sector emissions in absolute terms - namely, the overall volume of CO2 emissions produced. Like Greece, the country had a ""landmark"" 2023 for renewable generation, according to thinktank Ember.

Carbon Brief analysis shows that power-sector emissions in Germany fell by 43.23m tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2), or 18.4%, of 2019 values by 2023.

Despite this significant drop, the country's power sector is still the most polluting of all EU countries, responsible for 29.3% of EU power-sector emissions. This places it far ahead of Poland, the second largest polluter, which is responsible for 17% of emissions.

Germany has one of the largest populations in Europe and its energy demand sits at 514TWh (19% of EU total). When looking at per-capita emissions (as shown below), the country sits fourth in the EU for emissions, seeing a reduction of 0.51tCO2 in 2023 compared with 2019.

Portugal, Latvia and Finland decarbonised their power sectors the most relative to 2019, analysis shows.

Portugal saw renewables supply 61% of its electricity consumption in 2023, according to the country's grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais. This totaled 31.2TWh - the most it has ever recorded. This included a period in November where the country ran on just renewables for six days in a row.

Carbon Brief's analysis of Ember data placed the 2023 figure even high, with 73% of electricity from renewable sources.

As shown in the chart below, there were just three EU countries where power-sector emissions have increased since 2019 - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania. These countries are some of the smallest in Europe, collectively accounting for less than 1% of total EU power generation in 2023.

Malta increased its power-sector emissions by 0.11MtCO2, or 10.3%, of 2019 emissions. As an island nation, Malta's energy system is still heavily dominated by imported oil and gas, making up nearly 90% of power generation. (Malta has some of the lowest per-capita emissions in Europe, with 5.3 tonnes CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) per inhabitant in 2019, well below the EU average of 8.4tCO2e.)

Croatia, where emissions increased by 0.4MtCO2 or 13%, is similarly reliant on fossil fuels, with coal still dominating its power sector. While power demand has remained stable in recent years, net imports of electricity have dropped likely due to higher electricity prices in neighbouring countries.

Although renewable generation offset most of this, it did lead to a small jump in fossil fuel use of ~1TWh.

Lithuania saw emissions increase by 0.32MtCO2, from 0.57MtCO2 in 2019 to 0.89MtCO2 in 2023, Carbon Brief analysis shows. The country is currently heavily reliant on electricity imports, after the closure of its only nuclear power plant in 2010 changed it from a net exporter to a net importer.

Chris Rosslowe, senior energy and climate data analyst at Ember, tells Carbon Brief:

""Trends in generation in Lithuania don't tell you as much as in other countries as it imports most of its electricity since shutting down nuclear power in 2010. Import dependence is slowly lowering though - from ~75% in 2019 to ~55% in 2023 - and, like Croatia, renewables are growing faster than fossils.""

It is undergoing a particularly key period of transition. Lithuania's electricity grid currently operates synchronously with the Russia-Belarus power system, but it is planning to de-synch by 2025 and instead run with the continental Europe grid.

Additionally, it is among the countries that are seeing the fastest expansion of wind generation. It is also targeting halving its imports and generating 70% of its electricity from domestic sources by 2030, as it pushes for increased energy sovereignty and security.

Rosselowe notes that Malta, Croatia and Lithuania are all expected to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels in the coming years, offset in large part by growing renewables.

Overall, the Czech Republic remains the biggest per-capita emitter in the EU, as shown in the chart below. Between 2019 and 2023, emissions in the country did drop from 4tCO2 to 3.2tCO2, but it still sits 0.9tCO2 above the second highest per-capita emitter Cyprus (3.1tCO2).

The three countries that saw an increase in per-capita emissions match those where there was an increase in fossil fuel generation - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania.

Between 2019 and 2023, the share of renewable generation in the EU increased in all by one country, according to Carbon Brief analysis.

Italy saw renewable generation fall from 115.83 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2019 to 114.8TWh in 2023. This was broadly due to the impact of droughts in the country affecting hydropower generation, which hit in 2022, but had a continued impact in 2023.

This was a wider dynamic seen globally, which kept the world from hitting peak electricity generation emissions in 2023.

Slovakia, meanwhile, was the only country to see a dip in its share of renewable energy when comparing 2019 and 2023. This was minor, falling just 0.65% from 23.57% to 22.92%. The country has one of the smallest energy demands in Europe and, like Italy, saw a drop in hydro driven by droughts in 2022.

Malta and the Netherlands saw their share of renewables increase by more than 150% in 2023 relative to 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows.

The Netherlands increased its absolute share of renewable generation by close to 30% since 2019, as shown in the chart below. The country seeing the largest absolute increase in renewable generation, closely followed by Spain.

Nearly half the electricity produced in the Netherlands is now renewable, according to the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics.

This was predominantly wind generation, with the country adding more wind power than any other country in the EU between 2019 and 2023, both relatively and in absolute terms. Overall, the Netherlands increased its wind generation by 152% and Finland followed closely behind with a 143% rise.

Latvia, similarly, saw significant growth, with the share of renewables jumping from 49.5% in 2019 to 76.6% in 2023. This 27.1% increase is particularly key for the country, as it continues to target reducing its dependence on energy imports from Russia.

Spain added more solar generation in absolute terms over the four-year period than any other country in the EU, tripling its overall renewable generation.

Poland increased its solar generation by more than 1,500%, increasing generation by 12TWh albeit from a low starting point of just 0.71TWh in 2019. Renewables generated a record 26% of electricity in the country in 2023. However, coal still produces most of the country's electricity and continues to have a powerful impact on policy due to powerful lobbies.

Hungary has increased its solar share of generation the most since 2019, with an increase of 14%. It was followed closely by the Netherlands, with a 12.8% increase. Luxembourg increased wind power share of generation by more than the Netherlands - 17%.

Overall, just three EU countries - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania - saw an increase in the share of fossil fuel generation in 2023 relative to 2019, according to Carbon Brief analysis.

Over the same period, Luxembourg and Finland reduced fossil generation by more than 60%.

The Netherlands has reduced its fossil fuel share in the electricity system the most since 2019, falling by close to 30%. As shown in the chart below, this fall was mirrored by a significant increase in renewable energy generation.

In comparison with 2019, Ireland saw an increase in coal generation in 2023 making it the only EU nation to do so. In 2019, coal generation was at a record low in the country (0.51TWh) before jumping to 2.72TWh in 2022 due to a drop in wind generation.

However, since that point coal power generation has been continuing to fall again, in line with the wider trend seen over the past few decades.

Ireland has seen total electricity demand increase by more than 60% since 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows. The country's energy demand has been particularly driven by the growth of data centres, which accounted for 18% of energy demand in 2022, for example.

Despite the blip in coal generation, the share of fossil fuels fell by 2.5% between 2019 and 2023.

Portugal reduced its use of coal the most, relative to 2019, while Germany reduced the most in absolute terms. As discussed above, this was supported by surging renewable generation in both countries.

Pieter de Pous, programme lead in E3G's fossil fuel transition programme, tells Carbon Brief:

""Europe's phaseout of coal has been one of its biggest, most historical, monumental success stories of the last couple of years when you think about it. We've dropped consumption since 2016 by 50%, right? It's really enormous and it's a story that's rarely told.""

The last European Parliament elections saw a ""green wave"" of climate-focused politicians winning seats across the continent. In the years that followed, the EU approved a European Green Deal, including goals to cut emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.

European member states now have a ""critical role"" to play in implementing what has been agreed, notes Rosslowe. He adds:",carbonbrief.org,news,Carbon Brief,,0.1764705882352942,454852151,49,https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2RA0468.jpg,

Qualified are operators of new or modernized combined heat and power (CHP) plants that provide primary energy savings of at least 10 percent compared to the separate production of heat and electricity, as defined in the European Union's Energy Efficiency Directive.

CHP installations running on fossil fuels are not covered. ""Projects involving natural gas will be required to either close the aided installations or enable switch to renewable and low-carbon gases by 2050, to avoid lock-in of natural gas"", the Commission said in a statement.

The aid will take the form of a feed-in bonus for each megawatt hour of produced electricity, to be paid over 15 years. The amount of the premium is set through auctions, except for small installations (up to one megawatt electric) where the amount is determined by the Czech Energy Regulatory Office on an annual basis.

The Czech government expects the package to result in 9.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) savings per year.

The aid was subjected to review by the Commission to ensure it observes fair competition rules in the EU.

""This €3.2 billion Czech scheme will promote energy efficiency and help Czechia meet its CO2 emission reduction targets"", commented Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president in charge of competition policy at the Commission. ""Granting support through competitive tenders will limit the aid to the minimum and keep electricity prices low for consumers, at the same time ensuring that possible distortions of competition are limited"".

Last year, Energy Efficiency Directive (EU) 2023/1791 took effect, mandating EU countries to curb energy consumption by 11.7 percent by 2030 relative to projections for 2020.

The directive aims for a final energy consumption of at most 763 million metric tons of oil equivalent (MMtoe) by 2030, compared to the EU 2020 projection of 868.8 MMtoe. Final energy consumption by the definition of the directive means ""all energy supplied to industry, to transport, including energy consumption in international aviation, to households, to public and private services, to agriculture, to forestry, to fishing and to other end-use sectors, excluding energy consumption in international maritime bunkers, ambient energy and deliveries to the transformation sector and to the energy sector, and losses due to transmission and distribution"".

The directive sets a primary energy consumption target of no more than 992.5 MMtoe by 2030, compared to the EU 2020 projection of 1,176.1 MMtoe. Primary energy consumption by the definition of the directive means ""gross available energy, excluding international maritime bunkers, final non-energy consumption and ambient energy"".

Energy saving obligations, measured using the average final energy consumption during 2016-18 are set at 1.3 percent for 2024-25, 1.5 percent for 2026-27 and 1.9 percent for 2028-30.

The directive mandates member states to migrate their district heating and cooling systems to 100 percent renewable energy, waste heat or a combination of the two by 2050. In the nearer term, by 2028, district heating and cooling systems should use ""at least 50 percent renewable energy, 50 percent waste heat, 50 percent renewable energy and waste heat, 80 percent of high-efficiency cogenerated heat or at least a combination of such thermal energy going into the network where the share of renewable energy is at least 5 percent and the total share of renewable energy, waste heat or high-efficiency cogenerated heat is at least 50 percent"".

District heating and cooling systems that are built or substantially refurbished for a lifespan till 2030 should not use fossil fuels except gas, according to the directive.

Governments in the 27-member bloc have two years to adopt most of the measures contained in the directive into local legislation.

The directive is part of Fit for 55, the set of EU laws toward achieving a regional reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55 percent by 2030 relative to 1990.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.4431372549019608,454844928,11,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Czechia-to-Offer-35B-for-Heat-and-Power-CoGeneration-Projects-176932-582x327.webp,eng-9607050

President Joe Biden's administration was close to completing talks on a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine, according to a US official, a move intended to cement longer-term support for Kyiv in its war against Russia's invasion.

OpenAI said it had cut off five covert influence operations in the past three months, including networks in Russia, China, Iran and Israel that accessed the ChatGPT-maker's artificial intelligence products to try to manipulate public opinion or shape political outcomes while obscuring their true identity.

Germany was providing as much as €500-million in additional military aid to Ukraine, including air defence missiles, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said.

""We will continue to support you in this defensive struggle,"" Pistorius said on Thursday during a visit to Odesa, Ukraine, to meet Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, German broadcaster ARD reported.

The package includes missiles for medium-range Iris-T SLM air defence systems and a smaller number of shorter-range SLS missiles, drones for reconnaissance and combat in the Black Sea and spare parts such as replacement tubes for artillery systems supplied by Germany and engines for Leopard battle tanks.

Some of the weapons were about to be delivered to Ukraine, Pistorius said.

While Ukraine's allies are stepping up efforts to send more air defence assets, the US and Germany have been cautious about delivering weaponry that can hit targets inside Russia. Pistorius said this month he wanted Germany to deliver another €3.8-billion in military aid to Ukraine this year.

President Joe Biden's administration was close to completing talks on a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine, according to a US official, a move intended to cement longer-term support for Kyiv in its war against Russia's invasion.

The agreement would see the US support Ukraine's defence and security along a wide range of capabilities, including air defences and drones, and ramp up efforts to build up the country's defence industrial base to allow for more production of artillery and ammunition.

The US official detailed the state of the talks on condition of anonymity. The Financial Times earlier reported the development.

The move comes at a critical time in the war with Russia building up troop formations near Ukraine's border and stepping up air attacks on the country. Ties between Washington and Kyiv have also been strained by Biden's decision to skip a summit next month to discuss Ukraine's blueprint for peace that is being organised by Switzerland.

While several G7 leaders plan to attend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on the leaders of China and the US to join. The White House has said the US will be represented in some capacity. Beijing has instead called for an international conference that would bring both Russia and Ukraine to the table.

Biden announced last year that the US and other Group of Seven nations would pursue bilateral security pacts with Ukraine and encouraged other allies to do the same. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier this month during a visit to Ukraine said he believed the countries would be able to sign a 10-year accord in a ""matter of weeks"".

""These agreements send a clear message that Ukraine can count on its partners for sustainable, long-term support. That's not a matter to be debated from one year to the next -- nor is it a commitment by any one country,"" Blinken said.

OpenAI said it had cut off five covert influence operations in the past three months, including networks in Russia, China, Iran and Israel that accessed the ChatGPT-maker's artificial intelligence products to try to manipulate public opinion or shape political outcomes while obscuring their true identity.

The new report from the ChatGPT-maker comes at a time of widespread concern about the role of AI in global elections slated for this year. In its findings, OpenAI listed the ways in which influence networks used its tools to more efficiently deceive people, including using AI to generate text and images in larger volume and with fewer language errors than would have been possible by humans alone. However, the company said that ultimately, in its assessment, these campaigns failed to significantly increase their reach as a result of using OpenAI's services.

""Over the last year and a half there have been a lot of questions around what might happen if influence operations use generative AI,"" said Ben Nimmo, principal investigator on OpenAI's Intelligence and Investigations team, in a press briefing on Wednesday. ""With this report, we really want to start filling in some of the blanks.""

The company said it defined its targets as covert ""influence operations"" that were ""deceptive attempts to manipulate public opinion or influence political outcomes without revealing the true identity or intentions of the actors behind them"". The groups were different from disinformation networks, Nimmo said, as they could often promote factually correct information, but in a deceptive manner.

While propaganda networks have long used social media platforms, their use of generative AI tools is relatively new. OpenAI said that in all of the operations it identified, AI-generated material was used alongside more traditional formats, such as manually written texts or memes on major social media sites. In addition to using AI for generating images, text and social media bios, some influence networks also used OpenAI's products to increase their productivity by summarising articles or debugging code for bots.

The five networks identified by OpenAI included groups such as the pro-Russian ""Doppelganger,"" the pro-Chinese network ""Spamouflage"" and an Iranian operation known as the International Union of Virtual Media, or IUVM. OpenAI also flagged previously unknown networks that the startup says it identified for the first time coming from Russia and Israel.

French President Emmanuel Macron is set to host his US counterpart Joe Biden next week as the two leaders seek to step up cooperation on Ukraine.

Biden's first state visit to France will take place on 8 June and reciprocates Macron's trip to the US in 2022, the French presidency said. The two presidents will discuss the need for continued and unwavering support for Ukraine.

Days before the state visit, Biden is also due to attend the ceremony for the 80th anniversary of the battle of Normandy that led to the liberation of France and Europe in World War 2.

The meeting comes as European allies have grown increasingly concerned about what would happen if the US scales back its support for Ukraine, and how they could cover Ukraine's financial and military needs.

Biden's visit also comes a day before European elections, with Macron's centrist political alliance lagging far behind Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party in polls of voting intentions.

Sweden is looking at ways to unilaterally block imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) if Hungary stops or succeeds in watering down the European Union's proposed latest sanctions on Moscow.

EU member states are discussing sanctions targeting key Russian LNG projects, as well as a ban on using the bloc's ports to re-export supplies destined for third countries, as part of an effort to limit the Kremlin's ability to generate revenues from the fossil fuel. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has opposed the package and sanctions require the unanimity of the EU's 27 member states.

""If the sanctions package doesn't fit its purpose we are prepared to navigate on our own,"" Swedish Energy Minister Ebba Busch said in an interview on the sidelines of a meeting of ministers in Brussels. ""That's not optimal, but we are looking into the possibility of finding a way to further stop and put sanctions on Russian imports, specifically LNG.""

Busch didn't elaborate on how exactly the government would target energy imports from Russia, but said new measures that allow individual member states to effectively ban Russian LNG shipments without new sanctions were insufficient. The rules require countries to take into account the bloc's energy security, while nations like Spain have said that imports could simply be shifted to other EU countries.

Germany and the Czech Republic have called for the EU to set up a high-level working group on how to cut the remaining energy imports still coming from Russia after the dramatic reductions seen since the invasion of Ukraine.

While Sweden's imports of Russian gas are small, any measures would further signal member states' growing impatience over Hungary's continued obstacles on aid for Ukraine and sanctions, but also highlight disunity within the bloc.

""The aim of this whole war on Russia's side is to divide and conquer,"" Busch said. ""But Sweden will not wait if we don't succeed with the 14th sanctions package.""

Separately, Sweden is proposing to introduce broad EU import tariffs on Russian goods as soon as possible, with the proceeds going toward supporting Ukraine, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. Other countries like the US, UK and Canada have already introduced similar measures.

A senior Czech official urged allies to step up financing for an initiative aimed at delivering ammunition to Ukraine, saying only a quarter of those who made commitments had come through on financing.

More than three months after Czech President Petr Pavel publicised the effort to procure some 800,000 shells from sources outside the European Union, Tomas Kopecny, the Czech envoy overseeing the initiative, said only five countries had finalised payments so far.

""It's taking longer than we expected,"" Kopecny told reporters in Prague, where Nato foreign ministers were gathering to discuss aid in preparation for the alliance's summit in July in Washington. ""The main reason is the speed of the processes in different countries -- and the political will.""

The official warned that the pace needed to pick up, because the procurement process to arm Ukraine was competing with Russian efforts to tap a global supply of ammunition that Kopecny estimated at a ""single-digit million"" level. The 800,000 figure is a benchmark set by Pavel, but if resources are focused, Ukraine's allies could source as many as two million shells, he said.

Only one of the EU's big countries, Germany, had come through with funding of almost €600-million, Kopecny said. Ten other countries are going through domestic procedures to approve payments, whether through parliamentary passage or budget processes, he said.

Kopecny said Kyiv has been receiving stocks of ammunition for months -- and that the influx would ""multiply"" as of next month. He cited ""trustworthy commitments"" for some 500,000 shells, worth about €1.7-billion.

Moldova and Ukraine reached an informal agreement to keep natural gas flowing to the pro-Russian enclave of Transnistria after a transit contract with Gazprom expires at the end of the year.

Under the preliminary deal, a new route via Turkey is a viable option for getting Russian gas to Transnistria, the separatist region in eastern Moldova on the border of Ukraine, Moldovan Energy Minister Victor Parlicov said in an interview. Ukraine is closing its territory to Russian gas transit on 1 January 2025.

The arrangement comes as energy traders are watching how the end of Russian gas flows through Ukraine will affect Europe next winter. Allowing supplies to Transnistria may provide some encouragement that Ukraine transit deals with other countries might still be possible.

Ukraine's gas network operator in April rejected the renewal of interconnector agreements that would allow Russian gas to transit through the main cross-border point, Sudzha, next year. In the Moldova-Ukraine agreement, Gazprom could deliver the gas to Turkey and then via Bulgaria and Romania, but it would still have to go through Ukraine because of the design of the pipeline.

After the outbreak of war in Ukraine, Moldova gave up Russian gas, buying exclusively on the European market. But Gazprom continues to supply fuel to Transnistria, which provides Moldova with most of its electricity.

The European Union agreed to hike tariffs on imports of Russian grain to curb the Kremlin's revenues and prevent those shipments from destabilising the region's farm sector.

The tariffs, which also apply to Belarusian grain, will be in place from 1 July, EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said on X. EU ministers also made the decision to tackle illegal Russian exports of stolen Ukraine grain into EU markets, he said.

""The regulation increases duties on cereals, oilseeds and derived products from Russia and Belarus to a point that will in practice halt imports of these products,"" the EU said on Thursday.",dailymaverick.co.za,news,Daily Maverick,,0.1294117647058823,454804551,1,https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/11631002.jpg?w=1280,eng-9612091

The degree of modularity may vary between designs, and it may have a better possibility to integrate additional modularity in the early stages of design.

The global small modular reactor market size is estimated to be USD 5.8 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 6.8 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 2.3% during the forecast period. Factors such as the versatile nature of nuclear power and the relative advantages of SMRs such as modularization and factory construction are enabling the growth of the market.

""Small modular reactors (SMRS) are defined as nuclear reactors generally 300 MWe equivalent or less, designed with modular technology using module factory fabrication, pursuing economies of series production and short construction times,"" according to the World Nuclear Association. The ability of SMRS to meet the requirements of flexible power generation for a wide range of applications, such as power generation, process heating, desalination, hydrogen production, industrial applications, and replacing ageing fossil fuel fired power plants, has increased demand for them.

In 2022, the Asia Pacific dominated the global small modular reactor market, followed by Europe and Americas. The region, by country, has been segmented into the China, Japan, India, South Korea, and the Rest of Asia Pacific. Due to the enormous number of SMR projects in China, Asia Pacific is a big contributor to the small modular reactor industry in the current environment. SMRs have the potential to replace coal- and other fossil-fuel-fired power stations in the region for power production and process heat applications, which will likely promote the expansion of the regional small modular reactor market.

The upto 100 MW segment by power rating is expected to be the third-largest growing segment of the small modular reactor market. The reactor unit can be built in a factory and delivered to the site of installation. Because of the modular construction, many SMR units can be deployed together to satisfy varied energy demands. A 100 MW SMR's major use is electricity generating. It may function as a stand-alone power plant, supplying clean and dependable electricity to cities, industries, and isolated regions. The excess heat generated by a 100 MW SMR can be used for district heating, which involves distributing thermal energy to surrounding residential, commercial, and institutional buildings for space heating and water heating.

The gases segment by coolant is projected to be the fastest growing segment of the small modular reactor market. During operation, the gas-cooled reactor uses helium as a coolant medium, allowing it to be easily pressurized and maintain a stable high temperature, allowing for greater operational efficiency. Using gas as a medium in the reactor can prevent corrosion on the reactor's surfaces, reducing the need for maintenance. These operational advantages are propelling the gases segment forward. Graphite is used as a neutron moderator in gas-cooled reactors, and carbon dioxide gas is used as a coolant.

The light-water reactors segment by type is projected to be the fastest growing segment of the small modular reactor market. In 2022, the light water reactor category accounted for 40.6% of the small modular reactor market. These reactors, which use common water as a coolant, are the most widely used since they pose the fewest technological dangers. SMR designs based on LWR technology are similar to large-scale LWRs in use today. Such SMRS employ well-tested technologies and products with small and integrated components and higher passive safety measures over current big scale LWRS. Light-water SMRS have a better level of technological readiness than other SMB designs. Because traditional LWR technology is well-developed, these reactors provide fewer hurdles to present licencing processes. Most regulators are familiar with the technology, resulting in a relatively short learning curve for both regulatory bodies and designers in light water reactors. In the case of a Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR), this is done after the safety rods have been lowered and unlatched.

The hydrogen generation segment by application is projected to be the forth-largest growing segment of the small modular reactor market. Hydrogen is essential in a variety of industrial applications. It can help with the decarbonization of electricity and transportation by being used for energy storage or as a fuel for hydrogen fuel-cell cars, trains, ships, and aeroplanes. Hydrogen can be produced using the fast neutron reactor, molten salt reactor, and high-temperature reactor technologies. The type of reactor technology influences the choice of hydrogen technologies to be combined with the SMRS. Only electricity is required for a few hydrogen manufacturing systems, such as traditional electrolysis. In contrast, methods such as thermochemical cycles may just require process heat, whereas hybrid technologies, such as high-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) and hybrid thermochemical cycles, require both heat and electricity.

Europe is expected to grow at the second-highest CAGR during the forecast period. Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and the rest of Europe are all considered in the European small modular reactor market. Italy, Luxembourg, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Ukraine, Finland, Estonia, Poland, and Romania are included in the rest of Europe. Nuclear energy accounts for around 28.4% of the region's electricity generation mix, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2022. The region was responsible for 30.2% of global nuclear power usage. Investments in SMRS development, as well as a trend towards the usage of clean energy to address climate change, are expanding the potential for SMRS deployment in this region. For instance, the government dedicated USD 298 million to SMRS in 2021 as part of the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Low-Cost Nuclear (LCN) programme in November 2020. UKRI offered an initial match financing of USD 23 million to the UK SMR consortium lead by Rolls-Royce in November 2019 for the development of a conceptual SMR design. Rosatom (Russia) announced intentions to invest USD 7 billion in new nuclear technology by 2030 in June 2021.

In doing so, the court rejected a complaint filed by the former Polish government, which argued that the commission had acted unlawfully in taking the money after Poland had reached a settlement with the Czech Republic that ended the dispute over the mine.

The Czech Republic first brought its case against Poland before the CJEU in 2021. It claimed that Warsaw's decision to extend the operation of Turów, an open-cast lignite mine near the Czech border, was contrary to EU law and would cause environmental damage in the Czech Republic.

As an interim measure, the CJEU ordered the mine to suspend operations for the duration of the court proceedings. Poland refused to comply, arguing that the continued operation of the mine and nearby power plant, which produced 7% of Poland's electricity, was crucial for energy security.

As a result, the CJEU in September 2021 ordered Poland to begin paying daily fines of €500,000 until it complied. Poland then refused to pay those fines, leading the European Commission to deduct the money, €68.5 million in total, from Poland's EU funds.

In 2022, after it had reached an agreement with the Czech Republic to end the dispute over the mine, Poland launched a complaint against the European Commission's actions.

It argued that ""the settlement [with the Czech Republic] had the result that the financial effects of the measures ordered by the Court of Justice had ceased retroactively"", wrote the CJEU in a press release announcing Wednesday's ruling.

""Poland submitted that the commission's offsetting [of the money from EU funds] is therefore unlawful,"" it added. The money levied by the commission came from fines issued to Poland before the agreement with Prague, but it took the money after the agreement had been reached.

In its ruling on Wednesday, the CJEU dismissed Poland's complaint in its entirety. It found that the removal of the case from the court's register following the settlement with the Czech Republic did not relieve Poland of the obligation to settle the fines already accrued.

""Otherwise, the objective of the periodic penalty payment, namely to guarantee the effective application of EU law, such application being an essential component of the rule of law, would not be attained,"" noted the court.

It therefore found that the European Commission, which was responsible for collecting the fines, ""could legitimately offset the amounts payable in respect of that periodic penalty payment against amounts owed to Poland by the European Union"".

Poland can still appeal against the ruling. However, that decision will now be down to the new, more pro-EU government, led by Donald Tusk, that replaced PiS in power in December.

PiS MEP Beata Kempa told the Do Rzeczy weekly that she expects the Tusk government to file an appeal. However, she also expressed doubt as to how genuine that appeal would be.

Her PiS colleague in the European Parliament, Anna Zalewska, also called on the government to show ""firm action to defend the interests of Poland"" in the case. She called the CJEU's ruling a ""scandalous decision"" that ""legitimises lawlessness"".",notesfrompoland.com,news,Notes From Poland,Alicja Ptak,-0.2392156862745098,454783234,17,https://notesfrompoland.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TurowCoalMine_44a-1.jpg,eng-9616932

He is a business executive and has been a member of the Czech Parliament since 2017.

The ANO party is campaigning in the European elections under the motto ""Everything for Czechia"". Can you elaborate on that? What are you offering voters and what interests are you promising to defend?

""It is actually quite simple. When we say ""Everything for Czechia"" we mean that we will be fighting for our values and goals in the European Union. It is all about what we see in the European Commission and the way the European Union is treating some member states and the direction that has been set by the European Commission. We need a better Europe. If Europe is better, it will also be the best way for the Czech Republic.""

What are the hot priorities at this point that you feel have to be addressed?

""There are many issues with the Migration Pact, but for me it is mainly about what is not included.""

""The main priority for us is definitely the internal security of the EU, be it the conflicts around Europe or the Middle East. These conflicts are also connected to the problem of migration and then there is the Green Deal. Not the Green deal itself, but just parts of that legislation, like the package Fit for 55, and, last but not least, we want to be heard in the EU, which is connected to the right of veto.""

Let us look at some of those issues individually. You mentioned the right of veto. ANO has been very vocal about the need to maintain the right of veto in the areas where it still applies. Why do you feel that it is so important that it be maintained?

""I think that if all the member states can sit around the table, discuss many topics and finally find some conclusion and agree on compromises, it is a better message to the rest of the world that we are still connected, strongly together, and speak with one voice.""

Migration is a very divisive issue and it is one of the big topics in these elections. The Czech government abstained in the vote on the Migration Pact and the opposition parties have criticized it saying it contains ""masked"" quotas and many other problems. What is you take on the Migration Pact?

""I always say that what worries me the most is not what is included now, but what is not included. And that is better security on the borders, readmissions, because we don't have the best cooperation with the countries where the migrants are coming from, not just the countries of origin, but also the transition countries, and none of that is addressed in the pact. We also need to focus on fighting the smugglers and organized crime and that is also not in the package. After more than 10 years - because the migrant crisis started in 2011 - we don't have any tools how to stop this organized crime which is responsible for the biggest part of the problem with illegal migration. So there are many issues with the Migration Pact, but for me it is mainly about what is not included.""

Pundits talking about these elections say that the new make-up of the European Parliament will be decisive for the future of the Green Deal, which is another hotly debated issue. In this country people are concerned about the looming ban on combustion engines, since the Czech economy is driven by the automotive industry, the ban on gas boilers and farmers are protesting against restrictions linked to the Green Deal. How would you want to revise the Greed Deal. What do you feel is not viable?

""The first point I want to make is that the Green Deal as such - if we look at it from a broader view- is a good idea, because everyone wants to have a better environment. We know what's happening to the planet, there is just one planet and we can't move anywhere. And the goal to reduce emissions is something that almost everyone can agree on. The issues we have with it are not about keeping the water in the land, biodiversity, reforestation and stuff like that.

""The main issue concerns de-carbonization. In the last few years, the European Commission sent the member states a big amount of legislation linked to de-carbonization. But it is not just about the legislation itself, such as that on combustion engines, but it is also about a lot of regulations for companies, and a lot of paperwork and reporting that they are required to do. What I see as the biggest risk for European competitiveness is the emissions allowance system, because it is not working well. If you compare the US with 30 euros per emission and the EU with 80 to 100 euros per emission, it is obviously not working well for the productivity of companies and the EU industry.

""Also, when it comes to combustion engines there are still many things that don't add up. If you look at the weight of electric cars, how much money European companies like Volkswagen, Skoda or BMW spent on building up that combustion engine, the productive one, and it's not that bad on emissions etc. So if we are putting that much pressure on our companies then obviously we are losing competitiveness and that's what worries me the most.

""If we choke our economy and our companies they will not have enough money to invest in new technologies.""

""If you look to the other side of the world, to the US or even China, they have the same goal for zero emissions, they have pushed it forward to 2060, but what they did is they put many investments into coal power plants. They built so many coal power plants they produce energy comparable to 20 Temelin power plants -but my point is - they are using that profit to invest in new technologies. And if we choke our economy and our companies they will not have enough money to invest in new technologies. And that is what we are seeing now that even China is far ahead of us with new technologies and renewables and the other stuff. But if the price of electricity is what it is, our companies are not competitive enough and some of them are already moving to the United States. That's what worries me the most.""

Obviously Europe needs to increase its competitiveness against countries like the US and China. Apart from these aspects linked to the Green Deal, what would help Europe increase its competitiveness? Do you feel that it is overregulated?

""Yes, we are overregulated. When we talk to private companies, they usually say they don't even know all the things that they are supposed to report on each month because there are so many duties and regulations now. What would help is for the business environment to be predictable, and now it is not. And not just because of the price of emissions allowances, but because it is a trading system that involves speculations. If the companies have no idea what will be the price of energy next month and what new regulations will emerge from the Green Deal then they can't invest, because they don't know where to invest, they don't know if they have enough power to make their production work and that is what we feel is wrong.

""The first goal should be to put a price ceiling on emissions allowances, so we can say to the businesses, OK, that's predictable, that's what you need to know and that's how it will be for a few years. So that we can help Europe's competitiveness grow and not fall behind states like China or the United States. In our opinion, with the Green Deal we need to take a step back, look at the impact that it is having on competitiveness and then derate it. There are some clauses in the Fit for 55 package that enable this. And after two years we will see the results -if the combustion engine ban was a great idea or not - I don't think it was the best idea - but if we review it after one, two or three years, then it could be too late.

""For example the German economy is not doing too well these days and if the ban has a bad impact on the German economy, then that's crucial for us, because we depend mostly on the German economy. So I don't think we have the time to review this in two or three years, because in the meantime countries such as China will forge ahead.""

What about subsidies? Because we have heard from Czech farmers that the distribution of subsidies is so unfair around Europe, that it would be better if there were no subsidies at all across the board. How do you feel about that?

""That's obviously an issue. And agriculture is a part of the Green Deal that has not been concluded yet. That's why we see all those protests, because they know it could have a very bad impact. And that's also the point, because we can't say to those people that from 2027 we are going to put emissions also on houses, on private cars and if you can't afford it, we will find some funds and give you some money for that. But where? Money is asked of the member states and they need to contribute also if they want to get some finances from the EU. So I don't think this is the way to go. The free trade must be more free, not overregulated. The system is wrong. If we look at agriculture, almost one quarter of the EU budget goes to agriculture. It used to be 70 percent, so it is now better, but it is still a huge amount of money going to agriculture. And if you talk to the farmers, they don't even want that money, they just want to work on their farm with fewer regulations.""

What about your concept of self-sufficiency? Is that viable for Europe in the present day and age?

""We are still a big economy, but we can't depend on someone bringing us batteries, someone else pharmaceuticals or even agricultural products. We need to work on self-sufficiency. This was also an issue when we were trying to de-carbonize the EU really fast. We exported all the technologies for example to China. They learnt well, but now we are in a stage where we can't cut off from China -even in pharmacy. So we need to focus on what we can build, what we can grow, and even the brains that we have in the EU. And, of course, we need focus on better cooperation within the bloc.""

Looking at a future European Union - are you in favour of expansion? Would you prefer a closer-knit union or a looser alliance of states?

""The Balkan states are also important for us because of migration and the internal security of the EU. So the doors should be open, but on the other hand, there is no shortcut into the EU.""

""I always say that the doors to the European Union should be open. We have quite strict rules and procedures and if the states around us, Albania or North Macedonia, fulfill all those rules and close the chapters required, we should bring them into the EU. And, why do we need them? It is better for our economy, but also if we look at it from the security point of view. The Balkan states are also important for us because of migration and the internal security of the EU. So the doors should be open, but on the other hand, there is no shortcut into the EU.""

Looking at security -there is a war raging just 300 km from our eastern border. Czechia has been actively helping Ukraine since the start of the war, but now some parties, including ANO, say military support is not working and are pushing for peace talks. Can you explain why you think the EU should stop providing Ukraine with further military support?

""I must disagree with your question, because no one from ANO has ever said that we should stop supporting Ukraine -even militarily. No one has ever said that.""

So let me rephrase the question - what do you think is vital now for European security?

""Well, we are going to see what comes out of the peace conference in Switzerland, but we also have many good diplomats all around Europe and not just Europe, also the United States and other countries. And we should put all our efforts into talking about an armistice. Because every additional day when people are dying and the country's infrastructure is being hit with rockets will make it harder for Ukraine to recover and rebuild when the conflict is over.

""No one from ANO has ever said that we should stop supporting Ukraine -even militarily. No one has ever said that.""

""So it is not about - stop supporting Ukraine - it is about having other plans of action, like putting all the other states around one negotiating table and saying we need to stop the fighting, we need at least an armistice. It is not easy to get peace, but at least to stop the fighting. Stop the fighting and people will stop dying. We are part of the UN and in the UN, if you look at the voting on resolutions against Russia, there are still many states who abstained or voted against, and those are the states at which we should aim all our diplomatic power- to bring them on our side. We should use diplomacy, and economic leverage if needed, to try to isolate Russia -to tell them - sit with us and deal with this, if not we will do everything we can to stop you.""

Why is it important that people go to the polls and vote in the European elections- and why should they vote for your party?

""This is an important question. I am an MP in the Czech Republic and I can see that about 70 percent of the legislation we are dealing with in our national parliament is coming from the European Union. So people should know that; that it is not like ""Brussels is far from the Czech Republic"". We are Brussels. And we need to have people with common sense in the European Parliament who can do what is best not just for the Czech Republic but also for a better Europe.""",english.radio.cz,news,Radio Prague International,,0.2627450980392156,454753941,11,https://english.radio.cz/sites/default/files/styles/twitter/public/images/ea7123da5a2c8f57360fd5a8c557accc.jpg?itok=jgiuIBfV,

Blinken opened a short visit to Eastern Europe with a stop in Chisinau, Moldova's capital, where he announced the assistance at a news conference with President Maia Sandu. America's top diplomat said $85 million would go to bolster energy infrastructure and $50 million was aimed at overhauling the energy and farming industries and deterring disinformation.

""That in turn will bolster the ability of Moldovans to resist Russian interference, to hold free and fair elections, to continue down the path to the European Union and Western integration, to create more economic opportunity,"" Blinken said. ""One of the other things that's so important is sharing information about disinformation and misinformation, which is one of the most potent hybrid tools that Russia uses -- and that's something that we are doing.""

He planned to travel to the Czech Republic later.

Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security.

Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova's energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine's, which were being hit hard by Russia's military.

Meanwhile, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. ""We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,"" she said. ""Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.""

""Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,"" she added.

Blinken's trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia.

There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova, and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union.

Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc.

""There's not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there's ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,"" the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns.

""Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermining its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,"" Blinken said.

Blinken opened a short visit to Eastern Europe with a stop in Chisinau, Moldova's capital, where he announced the assistance at a news conference with President Maia Sandu. America's top diplomat said $85 million would go to bolster energy infrastructure and $50 million was aimed at overhauling the energy and farming industries and deterring disinformation.

""That in turn will bolster the ability of Moldovans to resist Russian interference, to hold free and fair elections, to continue down the path to the European Union and Western integration, to create more economic opportunity,"" Blinken said. ""One of the other things that's so important is sharing information about disinformation and misinformation, which is one of the most potent hybrid tools that Russia uses -- and that's something that we are doing.""

He planned to travel to the Czech Republic later.

Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security.

Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova's energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine's, which were being hit hard by Russia's military.

Meanwhile, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. ""We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,"" she said. ""Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.""

""Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,"" she added.

Blinken's trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia.

There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova, and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union.

Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc.

""There's not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there's ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,"" the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns.

""Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermining its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,"" Blinken said.

Premier Energy is the third largest natural gas supplier and distributor in Romania, the biggest electricity distributor in Moldova, and one of the largest renewable energy players in Romania and Moldova - with over 1,000 MW under ownership, management, or development.

The Rule 144A/Regulation S offering raised gross proceeds of €140 million and included a retail offering in Romania. The company raised approximately

€97.5 million through the issuance of new shares, and its principal shareholder, Emma Capital, a Czech Republic-based investment group, raised approximately €42.5 million. This resulted in a valuation for the company of approximately €490 million.

Loredana Chitu, Head of Dentons' Capital Markets team in Bucharest, who co-led the Dentons team, said: ""We are honored to have represented the syndicate of managers on the largest Romanian IPO of a private company in the last seven years. A big thank you to our clients, but also to the issuer, its advisors, as well as the FSA, BVB and Central Depositary, for the smooth execution of the deal. We are happy to have been able to put our combined skills in capital markets and energy to work for this important IPO. We are seeing increased interest in listing on the BVB among both domestic and international issuers, and are here to support this trend.""

Premier Energy's IPO announced the pricing of its IPO on May 16, 2024, and the first day of trading on the Bucharest Stock Exchange was May 28, 2024.

Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG, UniCredit Bank GmbH (Milan Branch) and WOOD & Company acted as Joint Global Coordinators for the IPO, with Alpha Bank Romania S.A. and BT Capital Partners S.A. as Joint Bookrunners.

Cameron Half, London-based US Securities and Capital Markets partner said: ""We are pleased to have advised the Global Coordinators and Bookrunners on another key transaction, demonstrating our ability to guide and support our clients through complex offering structures, involving several jurisdictions. This is the third high-profile renewable energy sector IPO in Eastern Europe on which we have advised on in recent years, following the IPOs of Hidroelectrica and Ignitis.""

Capital Markets partner Loredana Chitu in Bucharest and partners Cameron Half and Nik Colbridge in London led Dentons' cross-border team on the deal. They were supported by associate Alin Roca in Bucharest, associates Elijah Smith and US securities associate Pichrotanak Bunthan, and trainees Shanie Earl and Tom Day in London, as well as by a large team of lawyers from various practices, including: partner Claudiu Munteanu-Jipescu, counsel Elena Vlasceanu, senior associate Angelica Pintilie, associate Alin Dimache and paralegal Andrei Marinescu (all Energy), counsel Argentina Rafail and Cristina Marcu, senior associate Andreea Predescu, and paralegal Stefan Sundere (Corporate and M&A), partner Bogdan Papandopol, senior associates Luiza Onofrei and Isabela Gheorghe, and associate Diana Ceparu (all Real Estate), senior associate Stefi Ionescu and associate Alexandra Sofineti (both Banking and Finance), partner Liviu Togan and counsel Andrei Orbesteanu (both Litigation and Dispute Resolution), senior associate Simona Moisa (Employment and Data Protection), and partner Raul Mihu and associate Iulia Titirisca (both Competition and Antitrust).

Nik Colbridge, who leads Equity Capital Markets in Dentons' London office, said: ""The efforts of the combined teams to bring the deal to market in a tight window meant that the offering was significantly oversubscribed and ultimately delivered a great result for the company and for our clients. Building on this year's London IPO of Air Astana, and last year's IPO of Hidroelectrica, the ECM team in London continues to deliver expertise in advising financial institutions on Capital Markets deals across emerging markets.""

The United States is providing Moldova with $135 million in assistance for energy security and countering Russian disinformation, report NewsMaker.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken made this statement at a press conference with Moldovan President Maia Sandu. Blinken's visit to Chisinau occurred on his way to the Czech Republic, where he is scheduled to meet with foreign ministers of NATO countries.

It is expected that the US assistance will help Moldova diversify its energy sources and reduce dependence on Russian gas. Additionally, the US will support Moldova's efforts to combat fake news and propaganda spread by Russia.

Blinken's visit comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia may become new targets for Russian aggression. This marks the second visit by a high-ranking American official to Moldova in the last two months.

The US has already provided Moldova with $774 million in financial assistance since the start of Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. Of this amount, $300 million was allocated for energy security.

On May 29, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Moldova. In addition to meeting with the President of Moldova, he will also meet with other high-ranking officials of the country. It is expected that Blinken will announce a package of support for Moldova in its process of European integration and energy security.

This marks the second visit by Antony Blinken to Moldova since his visit in March 2022.

As reported by the President's office, since 1992, the US government has supported Moldova by providing over $2.5 billion. Since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine, the United States has provided Moldova with financial assistance amounting to $774 million, of which $300 million was allocated to overcome the energy crisis and strengthen energy security. Of these funds, $80 million were used to compensate bills for gas and electricity for low-income citizens, and $135 million are intended to increase domestic electricity generation and construct a 400 kV high-voltage line through the Straseni (Moldova) and Gutinaș (Romania) power stations, which will connect Moldova to Romania's power grid, facilitating integration into the European energy network.",odessa-journal.com,news,odessa-journal.com,,0.03529411764705892,454752697,4,http://odessa-journal.com/storage/uploads/news/20062/20062.jpg,eng-9606307

Blinken said that the United States had neither encouraged nor enabled such attacks. But he said that the Ukrainians needed to make their own decisions on how to best defend themselves -- a position he has stated before -- and that the U.S. government had ""adapted and adjusted as necessary"" as the war evolves.

When asked by a reporter whether his words ""adapt and adjust"" meant the United States could support attacks by Ukraine with U.S.-made weapons inside Russia, he said, ""Adapt and adjust means exactly that"" -- meaning those words, signaling flexibility from Washington.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Washington has sent the Ukrainians military aid but has repeatedly asked that they not fire U.S.-made weapons into Russian territory for fear of escalating the war.

Several European leaders have called on President Joe Biden to stop imposing those limits, among them NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and French President Emmanuel Macron.

Blinken made his remarks in Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, while standing beside Maia Sandu, the nation's president, who is expected to face a pro-Russian candidate when she runs for reelection in October. The two spoke to journalists after an afternoon meeting in the presidential offices.

""Our neighbors, our friends in Ukraine, they pay an outrageous price on a daily basis,"" Sandu said.

Blinken announced new aid to Moldova to address a range of issues arising from Russian aggression, including its invasion of Ukraine.

The first of two packages mentioned was $50 million in broad support for Moldova's industry and government, as well as for democratic processes. Blinken mentioned the energy and agriculture sectors, and the need to combat disinformation.

""What's so powerful here is the deep and deep-rooted commitment to democracy,"" Blinken said, ""in the face of bullying from Russia.""

Sandu thanked Blinken for American help in fighting corruption, building renewable energy infrastructure and addressing the ""adversities of democracy,"" a nod to Russian election interference.

The second aid package mentioned was $85 million to help Moldova increase its energy resiliency and reduce its dependence on electricity generated in a Russian-backed separatist region in the east, Transnistria. These funds, part of a $300 million commitment previously announced by the United States Agency for International Development, would help Moldova strengthen its battery storage capabilities and high-voltage transmission lines, among other energy needs, Blinken said.

Moldova recently ended its reliance on natural gas imports from Russia and now buys gas from a number of countries, including the United States.

Blinken's visit to Chisinau was the first stop in a trip aimed at showing U.S. support for nations facing a hostile Russia. Blinken is going next to the Czech Republic, where he is scheduled to attend a meeting of foreign ministers and top officials of NATO on Thursday and Friday. They plan to discuss how to best support Ukraine.

This trip follows Blinken's overnight visit to Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, more than two weeks ago.

Sandu has advocated Moldova's entry into the European Union, and has scheduled a referendum on the question for the same day as the presidential election in October.

U.S. and European analysts say Moscow is likely to try to interfere in the election, as it has done elsewhere in Europe. The Biden administration has spoken publicly of Russian agents carrying out such interference using different means, from hacking to orchestrating campaigns over social networks to doling out money to favored politicians.

About 1,500 Russian troops are in Transnistria, which borders Ukraine. U.S. officials are watching for any signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin might try to annex the territory.

The NATO session in the Czech Republic is officially aimed at firming up the agenda for the 80th anniversary meeting of alliance leaders in Washington in July. The group is not expected to declare that Ukraine will now join NATO, an aspiration that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reiterated following the Russian invasion. They are, however, expected to work out details for moving Ukraine along the process of joining.

As Russian troops press an offensive in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, the Ukrainian war effort has been flagging, in large part because of a shortage of weapons and munitions. There are also fewer citizens able to join the fight.

Biden recently signed a bill passed by Congress, despite some Republican opposition, that grants new military aid to Ukraine.

Russia is producing munitions at a rapid rate, and U.S.-led sanctions have failed to cripple its military industrial capabilities. Biden and his aides say China has played a decisive role in bolstering Russia through exports of dual-use equipment and other goods that have allowed it to strengthen weapons production. Blinken is expected to highlight China's support for Russia in his discussions at the NATO meeting in Prague.",seattletimes.com,news,The Seattle Times,Edward Wong,0.06666666666666665,454723089,4,https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05292024_ukraineBradley-tzrMay29_tzr_161341.jpg?d=1020x655,eng-9606307

On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. ""We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,"" she said. ""Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.""

""Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,"" she added.

Blinken's trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia.

Blinken visited Ukraine two weeks ago to reassure Kyiv of Washington's support in the face of increased Russian attacks in its north.

There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova, and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union.

Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc.

""There's not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there's ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,"" the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU.

""Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermining its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,"" Blinken said. ""I think Moldova has done a remarkable job in countering many of those attacks.""

Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow's intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for ""protection"" due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau.

In Georgia, those fears intensified on Tuesday when the country's parliament overrode a presidential veto of a ""foreign agents"" bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.

The bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as ""pursuing the interests of a foreign power"" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.

The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.

Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and ""hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.""

Blinken last week announced that the U.S. would impose travel bans on Georgian officials ""who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.""

Blinken's announcement did not identify anyone who has already been targeted, but it said the U.S. would also undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.-Georgia cooperation.

""It remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" he said. ""As we review the relationship between our two countries, we will take into account Georgia's actions in deciding our own.""

The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.

Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and ""hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.""

Blinken last week announced that the U.S. would impose travel bans on Georgian officials ""who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.""

Blinken's announcement did not identify anyone who has already been targeted, but it said the U.S. would also undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.-Georgia cooperation.

""It remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" he said. ""As we review the relationship between our two countries, we will take into account Georgia's actions in deciding our own.""

The situations in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will all be on the agenda at the NATO ministerial meeting in Prague on Thursday and Friday that will be the alliance's last major diplomatic get-together before leaders meet at a summit to celebrate NATO's 80th anniversary in Washington in July.

Blinken opened a short visit to Eastern Europe with a stop in Chisinau, Moldova's capital, where he announced the assistance at a news conference with President Maia Sandu. America's top diplomat said $85 million would go to bolster energy infrastructure and $50 million was aimed at overhauling the energy and farming industries and deterring disinformation.

""That in turn will bolster the ability of Moldovans to resist Russian interference, to hold free and fair elections, to continue down the path to the European Union and Western integration, to create more economic opportunity,"" Blinken said. ""One of the other things that's so important is sharing information about disinformation and misinformation, which is one of the most potent hybrid tools that Russia uses -- and that's something that we are doing.""

He planned to travel to the Czech Republic later.

Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security.

Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova's energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine's, which were being hit hard by Russia's military.

Meantime, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. ""We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,"" she said. ""Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.""

""Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,"" she added.

Blinken's trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia.

Blinken visited Ukraine two weeks ago to reassure Kyiv of Washington's support in the face of increased Russian attacks in its north.

There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova, and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union.

Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc.

""There's not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there's ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,"" the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU.

""Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermining its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,"" Blinken said. ""I think Moldova has done a remarkable job in countering many of those attacks.""

Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow's intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for ""protection"" due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau.

In Georgia, those fears intensified on Tuesday when the country's parliament overrode a presidential veto of a ""foreign agents"" bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.

Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security.

Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova's energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine's, which were being hit hard by Russia's military.

Meantime, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. ""We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,"" she said. ""Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.""

""Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,"" she added.

Blinken's trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia.

Blinken visited Ukraine two weeks ago to reassure Kyiv of Washington's support in the face of increased Russian attacks in its north.

There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova, and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union.

Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc.

""There's not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there's ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,"" the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU.

""Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermining its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,"" Blinken said. ""I think Moldova has done a remarkable job in countering many of those attacks.""

Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow's intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for ""protection"" due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau.

In Georgia, those fears intensified on Tuesday when the country's parliament overrode a presidential veto of a ""foreign agents"" bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.

The bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as ""pursuing the interests of a foreign power"" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.

The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.

Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and ""hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.""

Blinken last week announced that the U.S. would impose travel bans on Georgian officials ""who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.""

Blinken's announcement did not identify anyone who has already been targeted, but it said the U.S. would also undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.-Georgia cooperation.

""It remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" he said. ""As we review the relationship between our two countries, we will take into account Georgia's actions in deciding our own.""

The situations in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will all be on the agenda at the NATO ministerial meeting in Prague on Thursday and Friday that will be the alliance's last major diplomatic get-together before leaders meet at a summit to celebrate NATO's 80th anniversary in Washington in July.

""One of the other things that's so important is sharing information about disinformation and misinformation, which is one of the most potent hybrid tools that Russia uses -- and that's something that we are doing.""

He planned to travel to the Czech Republic later.

Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security.

Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova's energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine's, which were being hit hard by Russia's military.

Meantime, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. ""We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,"" she said. ""Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.""

""Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,"" she added.

Blinken's trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia.

Blinken visited Ukraine two weeks ago to reassure Kyiv of Washington's support in the face of increased Russian attacks in its north.

There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova, and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union.

Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc.

""There's not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there's ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,"" the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU.

""Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermining its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,"" Blinken said. ""I think Moldova has done a remarkable job in countering many of those attacks.""

Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow's intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for ""protection"" due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau.

In Georgia, those fears intensified on Tuesday when the country's parliament overrode a presidential veto of a ""foreign agents"" bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.

The bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as ""pursuing the interests of a foreign power"" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.

The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.

Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and ""hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.""

Blinken last week announced that the U.S. would impose travel bans on Georgian officials ""who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.""

Blinken's announcement did not identify anyone who has already been targeted, but it said the U.S. would also undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.-Georgia cooperation.

""It remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" he said. ""As we review the relationship between our two countries, we will take into account Georgia's actions in deciding our own.""

The situations in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will all be on the agenda at the NATO ministerial meeting in Prague on Thursday and Friday that will be the alliance's last major diplomatic get-together before leaders meet at a summit to celebrate NATO's 80th anniversary in Washington in July.

Huge profits for Orlin's former board of directors. Daniel Obajtek received the highest salary

Orlen's board members received a total of between PLN 1.44 million and PLN 2.79 million in 2023, according to the company's supervisory board report published by the company on Tuesday. The highest reward - PLN 2.79 million - went to former president Daniil Obajtek.

The remuneration of the members of the Orlen Board of Directors: Patricia Klarica, Józef Wijrecki, Armin Artwijcik, Adam Burak, Jan Szewczak and Piotr Sabat amounted to between 2.26 and 2.42 million PLN. The salaries of the three remaining members of the Orlen Board of Directors: Robert Berkowski, Iwona Waksmundzka Oleniczak and Krzysztof Nowicki amounted to between PLN 1.44 and 1.66 million. In total, the entire Board of Directors received just over PLN 24 million in 2023.

Members of the Supervisory Board for 2023 received approximately PLN 150,000. To more than 184 thousand zlotys. The largest amount was raised by Council President Wojciech Jasinski. Janina Goss, which was canceled on December 13, 2023, received PLN 159,000. PLN, and Michał Klimaszewski, who was a member of the Council until the end of October 2023 - PLN 147,000. Zloty. The remaining members of the Council were paid approximately 170 thousand Polish zlotys. To more than 174 thousand Polish zlotys per person.

This is a win-win for both the airport and the City.

Excess power will go back into the local grid. This is a shining example of wise use of Bipartisan Infrastructure funds, and a great project that can be replicated on other public sites, and even spur the development of community solar projects in challenged neighborhoods, like the new solar resiliency hubs in Cedar Rapids. If played right, it will build public-private synergy among community sectors.

The Iowa City Climate Action and Adaptation Plan calls specifically for ""one or several pilot community solar projects ... that will result in expanding access to the benefits of solar renewable energy to our neighborhoods ... with an emphasis on the equitable distribution of benefits."" Neighborhood projects ""consist of off-site arrays of solar panels whose electricity can be shared by more than one household (or other user) through a subscription service."" (IC Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, section 1.5)

If the full potential of solar power is to be unlocked, it will take a mixture of installations in public spaces, neighborhoods, and private homes.

According to the 2021 Princeton Net Zero Report, we will need up to 39 times the solar power we have today to reach net zero by 2050. The Princeton report notes that due to its size and cost advantages, utility-scale solar will need to play the biggest role in helping to create a decarbonized economy. Of course, the same is true for utility-based wind and geothermal power.

As the synergy created by local public space, neighborhood and private projects grows, the utility companies will have to take notice and follow suit. Not to mention the fact that solar and geothermal are cheaper to implement than coal and nuclear. (Citizens' Climate Lobby)

Over 20% of the nation's airports have adopted solar power in the last decade. Airport/subscription-based community solar programs are already in place in Tallahassee, Tampa, Austin, and San Francisco. Kennedy International is building one. Also, there are airport-community partnerships in places like Denver; Cochin, India; Brno, Czech Republic, Quincy, IL, and even Middleton, WI (pop. 21,827).

Kansas City is doing a feasibility study: ""We're looking to power the entire city,"" said their city manager. Solar costs are way down, 85% in the last decade. It's the cheapest source of new energy, and accounts for close to half of new generation capacity in the U.S. It just makes sense!

It makes sense for Iowa City to build on the Airport project, and one day soon, to add such community capability. Then it will be win-win-win, airport, neighbors, and planet.

Intelligence experts have warned that Europe is under a growing threat from Russian sabotage operations, and believe those operations aim to secure concrete military results in Ukraine, political and economic costs to Europe, and nuisance value.

""We are experiencing the early stages of a systematic activation of Russian sleeper cells worldwide,"" Joseph Fitsanakis, professor of Intelligence and National Security Studies at Coastal Carolina University, told Al Jazeera. ""This is an unprecedented phenomenon in Western post-war history.""

The Financial Times this month cited intelligence of imminent Russian hybrid operations in Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and a report from Chatham House, a London-based think tank, detailed incidents across Europe that ""match predictions of what Russia would attempt to do in advance of an open conflict with NATO"".

The author of that report told Al Jazeera that Russia has a scattershot of aims, including causing trouble just to see what will happen.

""Russia has this view of security where anything they do to damage us is relatively speaking good for them because it makes them stronger,"" said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House. ""That in itself is an incentive to do things which are disruptive.""

In late April, two Finnair flights were forced to return home after GPS jamming prevented them from landing at Tartu, Estonia's second-largest city. The airline suspended flights for a month to find an alternative landing system.

The Finnish transport agency blamed Moscow.

""It is possible that the interference observed in aviation currently [is] most likely a side effect of Russia's self-protection. In practice, self-protection interference is used to prevent the navigation and control of drones controlled by [global navigation satellite systems] or mobile frequencies,"" it said in a statement. ""The interference has not only remained within Russia's borders, but has also reached Finnish territory.""

Giles explained, that the GPS jamming ""may have started with absolutely nothing in mind with regard to disrupting air traffic across Europe ... But once it became clear that those disruptive effects are substantial and there's no downside to Russia for doing it, then there's no reason why they shouldn't expand.""

This nuisance approach may not sound alarming for European security, but at the very least it suggests that Russia feels no constraints against performing any disruption of which it is capable.

And the disruption goes well beyond nuisance.

Soviet operatives and their proxies would typically target network industries such as electric cables, power stations, pipelines, transport and telecommunications, Daniela Richterova, a senior lecturer in Intelligence Studies at the War Studies Department of King's College London, told Al Jazeera.

That is precisely the kind of infrastructure that has reportedly been attacked.

""We're seeing this happen at a time of escalation. That was a key part of [Soviet] doctrine, that sabotage operations were meant to be used also in a time of peace if necessary, but especially in times of war, and they were meant to undermine the enemy's resolve, power and war effort.""

The use of proxies is also a telltale sign, she said.

Last month, Germany arrested two dual nationals on suspicion of plotting to plant explosives at US military facilities in Bavaria. The UK has arrested several people this year on similar suspicions. The people arrested are not considered to be members of the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), which typically plans sabotage operations.

The GRU is also suspected of acting directly.

In early May, NATO said GRU had launched cyberattacks against critical infrastructure in Germany, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden. All of them, along with Finland and Estonia, are among the Nordic group of countries that comprise Russia's most vocal critics and Ukraine's most dedicated allies in Europe. The GRU is also believed to field 20 to 40 operations officers, said experts.

Russian government officials generally do not comment on their own covert operations, but on Tuesday Putin reciprocated Western accusations to mark the anniversary of the FSB, Russia's Federal Security Service, whose duties include guarding the borders.

""Largely due to the resolve of the border security troops, numerous attempts to break into the Russian territory by mercenaries, traitors and enemy sabotage groups have been thwarted,"" said Putin, referring to incursions on Russian territory by anti-Putin Russian militias operating from Ukrainian soil.

""Those who planned these terrorist raids on our land have miscalculated and were met with a harsh and brutal rebuff,"" said Putin in a video address.

Russia's ultimate aim is military advantage, said Fitsanakis.

""Currently the Russian sabotage campaign appears to be aimed primarily at disrupting the military supply chain from the West to Ukraine.""

That means stopping the flow of weapons, or destroying the weapons themselves, and Russia's attempts to do so go back a decade. Last month, Czech police said the detonation of 63 tonnes of ordnance intended for Ukraine at a warehouse in Vrbetice in October 2014 was the work of GRU.

Front-line states Poland and Romania, from whose borders all war materiel enters Ukraine, are at obvious risk, said Fitsanakis, but earlier stages in the supply chain are equally critical. That includes Norwegian logistics facilities, ports on the US eastern seaboard, and military instructors in Darwin, Australia.

""A typical example is the port of Alexandroupolis in Greece, which the US Department of Defense credits as providing Washington with 'strategic access' to its Ukrainian ally,"" said Fitsanakis. ""Until recently, the port in this small northern Greek city was far removed from the epicentre of global geopolitics. As a result, security had to be elevated drastically within weeks.""

In addition to military targets, Fitsanakis added, ""Their skills are evolving with an eye to intensification, in case of an all-out war with NATO.""

In that case, sabotage operations would spread to the full gamut of network industries, aiming to shut down travel, power and telecommunications overnight, sending civilian society back to the 19th century and creating political pressure on governments to sue for peace - what Fitsanakis calls, ""mass-scale psychological objectives"".

Early this year, a series of NATO military chiefs publicly warned that the latest intelligence suggested a Russia-NATO war in the next five to eight years was more likely than had previously been thought, and European militaries should prepare accordingly.

EU governments have stepped up long-term contracts to defence industries since January, but it is more difficult to provide security over sprawling infrastructure.

The prime example of this is the North Sea, said Christian Bueger, a professor of Maritime Security at the University of Copenhagen.

""The North Sea today is just a dense industrialised infrastructure environment where there's multiple points of failure,"" he told Al Jazeera.

It's not just the pipelines, data and electricity cables that criss-cross the shallow sea floor, which have already come under suspected attack - most recently when a Russian-operated Chinese merchant vessel dragged its anchors on the sea floor, rupturing the Baltic Connector gas pipeline and telecoms cables between Estonia and Finland last October.

""We are also talking about a lot of emerging infrastructure,"" Bueger said. ""In many ways, the future of the green energy transition hangs on what we can do in the North Sea.""

That includes future offshore wind parks, hydrogen pipelines, and disused oilfields that are intended for carbon storage.

""We haven't even started to consider what the security implication of carbon storage will be,"" Bueger said.

Compared with protection, disruption is frighteningly easy. ""You don't need a submarine,"" said Bueger. ""Most of the time it will be easier to do it from the surface to hide in the official traffic ... you can do it with divers, you can do it with anchors ... you can also potentially do it with submersibles and autonomous vessels.""

NATO has started a subsea infrastructure protection centre.

France and Italy are co-ordinating on a system of marine sensors. The Royal Navy is acquiring an underwater surveillance vessel. But the biggest problem is jurisdictional, said Bueger, who is involved in several transnational projects to build information-sharing protocols across the military, coastguard, law enforcement and shipping industry in EU NATO countries.

""There's been a complete and abject failure by Western leaderships to explain to their electorates just what is at stake,"" said Chatham House's Giles.

""It's telling that the primary instinct from a lot of people seems to be, 'What other defensive measures can we take?' that are going to make life more expensive and inconvenient across Europe,"" he said. ""It's all defensive, it's all reactive. There's nothing apparently being suggested to deal with the root of the problem, which lies in Moscow.""

There are plenty of self-imposed constraints Europe could do away with to push back against Russia. Ukraine has pleaded with Germany to provide long-range Taurus missiles to attack Russian infrastructure - something Germany resists for fear of provoking a nuclear attack.

A growing chorus of legal experts says Europe may confiscate 210 billion euros ($228bn) in EU-held Russian central bank assets. France's President Emmanuel Macron has raised the prospect of sending NATO troops to man Ukraine's rear, and Estonia's Kaja Kallas says some have already done so. Nordic and Baltic countries fearing attack are already putting their economies on a partial war footing, but Germany finds itself unable to overcome legal constraints to spend more on the military.

Giles said all this allows Russia to steal a march on Europe, ""[Russia's] idea of how much you can do without precipitating conflict has been precipitated by Western countries not setting boundaries.""

""The fact that there's no downside is the defining factor of how Russia has seen sub-threshold operations over the last decade.""",aljazeera.com,news,Al Jazeera Online,John T Psaropoulos,0.07450980392156858,454674344,1,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2018-11-02T160626Z_951838612_RC191D3F4740_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-RUSSIA-PUTIN-1716974507.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,eng-9600352

Mr. Mach, your party is known to be highly critical of EU regulations, and in fact would like Czechs to be able to vote in a referendum on whether they want to stay in the EU or leave. So I assume that you're running in the elections in order to try and change something in the way that the European Union works or the set course. Is that right?

""Yes, you are absolutely right. We oppose regulation in general on the European Union level. And the strongest regulation ever is the Green Deal. It is supposed to completely ban combustion engines from the European Union market as of 2035. It makes energy, electricity, and other energy sources very expensive, and it makes Czech businesses less competitive in comparison with the rest of the world. I think it really endangers our industry, it makes the life of ordinary people very difficult because it makes energy expensive. My goal in the European Parliament is to have a new vote on the Green Deal. We want to completely vote it down.""

""There is a chance, for the first time in the history of the European Parliament, that the opposition could have a stronger vote, and push through on some issues. ""

So you feel that at this point, Euro critics stand a bigger chance of gaining a voice in the European Parliament?

""Yes, I do, for the first time in history. We can observe that from the very beginning of the EU, it has been ruled by a grand coalition of the Party of European Socialists and European People's Party. Those who opposed giving more power to the EU were considered, by the majority, as enemies and as people who have no right to participate in the decision-making. Now, there is a chance for the first time in the history of the European Parliament, that this opposition could have a stronger vote, and push through on some issues, including the Green Deal.""

Even if that turns out to be so, climate change is a problem that is not going to go away and needs to be addressed. You may argue that Europe is not financially in shape to implement the Green Deal. But what would you do instead?

""First of all, I think that the Green Deal is counter-productive. Under the Green Deal, the emissions of carbon dioxide are much more expensive in Europe than the emissions of the same volume of carbon dioxide in China. In China, they also have an emissions trading scheme, but there the price is different. (The price is set by the government or the European Union, depending on how many permits it issues.) Due to the fact that the same volume of C02 emissions is more expensive in Europe than in China, this directly leads to businesses closing in Europe and going to China. And paradoxically, production in China, India, or Brazil, is often more expensive for energy.

""Due to the Green Deal, C02 emissions in Europe went down by maybe one-third, but global emissions rose significantly because the production moved from Europe elsewhere.""

""So, by adopting the Green Deal, we will completely undercut our economy, and the impact on the global climate is rather the opposite. We can observe that due to the Green Deal, C02 emissions in Europe went down by maybe one-third, but global emissions rose significantly because the production moved from Europe elsewhere. It simply does not work. My idea is that it would be much better if in the Czech Republic we could decide ourselves what to do. For instance, I myself would be in favour of re-forestation - I think that this would be a much better solution for our country. We would have better forests and more forests, and it would be a small contribution to the global climate as well.""

Turning now to some very divisive issues in this campaign. Opinion polls show that what Czechs are most concerned about is migration and safety. Looking at migration first, Czechia is one of the 15 EU member states which has just sent the Commission a letter asking for it to look for new ways to address the problem of migration with the help of third countries. What is your take on the present Migration Pact and what would you want to change about it?

""If a migrant from North Africa arrives in Europe, and he doesn't want to come to the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic doesn't want him - why should we be obliged to accept him or pay instead?""

""We strongly oppose the Migration Pact, and just like I want a new vote on the Green Deal, I also want a new vote on the Migration Pact. We have criticized the government, who in our opinion, was not telling the truth. They said there are no quotas, they said we would eventually have an exemption, because we have hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, and I claim that neither of these things are true. In the Migration Pact, the Commission is supposed to set the number of migrants that each country should have, calculated on the basis of population numbers and the GDP of the EU. For the Czech Republic, it should be a 3% share. There is an option that instead of taking in migrants, you can pay out - which would be very expensive for the Czech Republic. If a migrant from North Africa arrives in Europe, and he doesn't want to come to the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic doesn't want him - why should we be obliged to accept him or pay instead? There is no logic.""

But we are a part of the European Union, and the EU has a problem. So how would you go about resolving it? Would you support the suggestion that the EU should cooperate with third countries outside of the EU for the problem to be resolved there, so there isn't such an influx? How would you go about it?

""First of all, each member state should be completely responsible for protecting its borders. In the Czech Republic, people can only arrive to the Schengen area by plane, and we completely protect these borders. No one without a proper visa or passport can enter the country illegally by plane. Countries like Hungary and Poland have built fences to protect their land borders. The same responsibility should lie with the countries that have a maritime border, and they should be responsible for turning the ships that take illegal immigrants back to their country of origin. This is the first point - every country from the Schengen area should protect its external borders. If the EU can help with something, it could negotiate with Libya and maybe Turkey, so the EU, on behalf of the member states, could open some migration centres on their territory, where the migrants would wait for a decision as to whether a member state would accept them or not.""

Staying on the subject of security and looking at the war in Ukraine, the Czech Republic has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the war began and has sent military and humanitarian aid. Some parties are now increasingly pushing for peace negotiations. What is your take on this? Should the country continue helping, and if so, in what way? And what should be the stance of the EU?

""We have called for peace negotiations from the very beginning. I am afraid that the current strategy of the West and Ukraine is wrong and inefficient. If the current goal of Ukraine and the West, at least as it is officially declared, is to get the whole territory of Ukraine back under its control, it seems to me that the current strategy is not working. I'm afraid that the current strategy will only lead to a situation where Ukraine will have no more soldiers to fight, which would be a clear victory for Russia. I think we should change our strategy, and peace negations are the obvious way how to deal with this situation.""

In the meantime, are you against further military aid to the country?

""I think that what should come in the first place should be a basic elementary agreement on a cease fire, which would open the door to peace negotiations. Because, if the official position of the West and Ukraine is ""We are ready to negotiate only after all Russian troops leave Ukrainian territory"" then that is simply not realistic. They need to accept that peace negotiations should start, there could be a cease fire, and that could open up a space for the negotiations to proceed. I think that maybe a referendum could be organized under some international surveillance.""

A referendum on what?

""In the eastern territories of Ukraine, in the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk republics referenda could take place in which people could vote on whether they want to be part of Ukraine, whether they want independence or whether they want to belong to Russia. In my opinion -if there is a clear tendency of these people to declare their independence from Ukraine, then the civilized way how to resolve this is a referendum and not a war.""

Turning back to the workings of the European Union - decision making and the right of veto. The right of veto is still implemented in three areas of EU decision making. I understand that you are strongly against abolishing that right in those areas?

""Yes, in my opinion, international cooperation should be based on unanimity, that is on the right of veto. Therefore, I was strongly against the Lisbon Treaty back in 2009, because it gave more powers to the EU, it moved many areas of decision-making from unanimity to a qualified majority vote. So we oppose any proposals to get rid of the unanimity principle in the few remaining areas where we have it.""

But it also complicates decision making sometimes, so how would you address that?

""I would love it if the EU moved back to being as it was before Maastricht, or I would love an EU that would look like EFTA, the European Free Trade Association.""

""In my opinion, no one should prevent countries who want to have some common policy to have it, but we should not force countries who don't want it, to participate. For example, countries that want to have the euro can have it, but countries who want to retain their own national currency should not be forced to give it up. Another example is that some countries are part of the Schengen area and some are not. Therefore, I don't think we need a qualified majority, I think we can have a European Union where countries participate or not in different areas, on the premise of voluntary participation. Those who want to have some policies can have them, and those who don't want to participate should not be forced to do so.""

It sounds like you would prefer a European Union as it was 25 years ago, a looser alliance of states, rather than it being closer-knit?

""Exactly. I would love it if the EU moved back to being as it was before Maastricht, or I would love an EU that would look like EFTA, the European Free Trade Association. If you look at EFTA, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Lichtenstein, they don't have any system of tax redistribution or subsidies, they do not need a common currency to trade. EFTA is based on unanimity, everyone in EFTA has veto power over everything, and it works quite efficiently.""

""I oppose any enlargement. We don't like the fact that we are out-voted in more and more areas, or that our taxpayers' money is used for something else than in favour of Czech, and any enlargement would only add to this.""

Looking at the future European Union, are you in favour of expansion?

""I think it should be clear from what I have said, that under the current situation, with the many powers of the EU, the vast regulation, redistribution, and qualified majority voting, I oppose any enlargement. We don't like the fact that we are out-voted in more and more areas, or that our taxpayers' money is used for something else than in favour of Czech citizens, and any enlargement would only add to this.""

Why is it important for Europeans to go to the polls in these elections?

""Because the European Union has the power to decide on legislation. It decides on how expensive energies are, what we can use for driving, whether some engines are banned or not. The civilized way to have your say is to vote and be represented in the body where these decisions are taken. Those who favour these decisions, as well as those who oppose them, have the right to be represented in the European Parliament. I encourage everyone to take advantage of this right to vote in the European elections.""",english.radio.cz,news,Radio Prague International,,0.1450980392156862,454667105,27,https://english.radio.cz/sites/default/files/styles/twitter/public/images/eaa0ade127cc4aa0a35e78ffa5542960.jpg?itok=ZH_gZkdw,

The latest innovation in geosynthetic fabric is fiberglass geogrid. Fiberglass filament is used in its construction. This product uses a specific weaving method. It has a special remedy for it. Fiberglass geogrid extends the road's useful life by having strong tension and a big floor bearing capacity. This cloth is appropriately placed on a resistant performance, but its tensile electricity is excessive. It is suitable for use in the reinforcing of asphalt, concrete, cement, and soft soil, among other materials. The warmth resistance of fiberglass geogrid is higher than that of metal-plastic geogrid. This fabric is distinguished by its exceptional thermal stability. It sounds good below a high temperature.

Fiberglass geogrid is structurally stable for a long time. It is suitable for ongoing projects. Soil stabilization, embankment strengthening, and asphalt pavement are three major applications for fiberglass geogrid. It has the ability to effectively prevent the floor from settling and cracking. Using fiberglass geogrid can drastically reduce the cost and effort of development by reducing the asphalt overlay thickness.

Blinken plans to spend this week showing U.S. support for nations facing a hostile Russia in visits to Moldova and the Czech Republic, where he is scheduled to attend a meeting of NATO foreign ministers that will discuss how to bolster Ukraine.

Mr. Blinken, who made an overnight stop in Kyiv more than two weeks ago, is expected to fly into Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, on Wednesday and meet with Maia Sandu, the nation's president, who is running for re-election. Ms. Sandu has advocated for Moldova to join the European Union, and she has scheduled a referendum vote on E.U. membership on the same day as the general election in October.

She is expected to run against a pro-Russia candidate, and U.S. and European analysts say Moscow is likely to try to interfere in the election, as it has in other votes in Europe. The Biden administration has spoken publicly of Russian agents carrying out such interference using a variety of means, from hacking to boosting campaigns over social networks to doling out money to favored politicians.

U.S. officials said Mr. Blinken would speak with Ms. Sandu and other top officials about potential threats to the country's democratic processes, as well as efforts to wean the nation off electricity generated in the pro-Russia separatist region of Transnistria. Moldova recently ended its reliance on gas imports from Russia.

""I anticipate he'll have a robust package of support for Moldova's transition, both energy independence or less dependence on sources to the east but also on support for democracy against Russian threats,"" James O'Brien, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, said in a phone call with reporters on Friday.

NuScale and Doosan are reported to be in the final stages of participating in a related and much bigger deal reportedly worth a total of $37 billion deal to supply 24 SMRs to Standard Power, a US information technology infrastructure firm.

NuScale and its financial investor ENTRA1 Energy LLC are reported to be working on details of the deal with Standard Power and, according to KED, an announcement is expected in the next few weeks. As part of the deal, Doosan Enerbility will supply key systems and components including reactors and steam generators. ENTRA1 Energy LLC also is investing in NuScale for applications of nuclear energy for power production, hydrogen production, water desalination, and process heat.

NuScale Questions KED Report

It is not entirely clear that there is an agreed upon term sheet between NuScale and Doosan for the reactors and steam generators in terms of the scope and value of the deal.

In an unexpected response to the media report, NuScale reportedly described the KED report in critical terms calling it ""speculative."" In a press statement to the Korea Herald, the spokesperson for NuScale discounted the size of the order for equipment and the number of SMRs expected to be built for US data centers.

""While we do anticipate a substantial order, the precise numbers appear to be based on a vague estimate. For instance, it's unclear how many SMRs Standard Power has agreed to purchase. Initially, there was mention of a project involving six SMRs, and it seems like this number was arbitrarily multiplied to 24,"" the official stated.

""Based on our current understanding and agreements, a single building [data center] can only house up to 12 SMRs. And assuming making two buildings could automatically accommodate 24 SMRs is also not accurate,"" he added.

NuScale's statement muddies the waters about the scope and value of the data center deal. The original NuScale press release last year referred to 24 SMRs, 12 for each data center location. Now it seems things are not so sure. Somehow, NuScale and Doosan are out of alignment with each other on this deal.

Separately, the Korea Herald reported Doosan Enerbility saw its shares soar more than 16% following KED's news report that it is likely to secure $1.46 billion worth of orders for NuScale Power's SMR project in the US. Its stock closed at $21.64/share. Doosan Group's stock also peaked at $160.43/share.

The US stock market is closed for the Memorial Day holiday. In after hours trading, NuScale's stock closed at 8 PM on Friday 5/24 at $7.85/share after an open that morning at $6.98/share. Volume was 5,754,00 shares. 52 week low $1.81/high $11.21. According to its March 2024 financial report, cash on hand was $132M compared to $216M in March 2023.

Scope of the Standard Power Data Center Project

According to data center trade press reports, Standard Power wants the SMRs for two massive data centers, 12 of them in Ohio and the other 12 in Pennsylvania. Each site will need 12 of NuScale's 77 MWe SMR for a total at each site of 924 MWe of power for each data center or nearly 2 GWe in all.

NuScale's 50 MWe design received approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 2020. The regulatory agency accepted NuScale's application for the uprated design of 77 MWe in August 2023. Approval of the 77 MWe design by the NRC is expected within 24 months' time or August 2025 more or less.

How Ready is NuScale to Proceed?

For NuScale to place an order, or phased orders over time, for $1.5 billion in nuclear reactor equipment from Doosan, it would have to go to capital markets with a firm book of orders in hand as well as financing for the SMRs from Standard Power and its investor ENTRA1 Energy LLC.

NuScale announced the 24 SMR project for the data centers in October 2023. A month later the company's first-of-a-kind project to build six 77 MWe SMRs for UAMPS at a site in Idaho was terminated due to rapidly rising costs that thwarted efforts to sign up enough UAMPS members to share in the costs and to subscribe to buy power from a completed project. This setback raised questions about NuScale's ability to proceed with the data center power project. The commitment by Doosan this week is a major confidence builder in NuScale's future and for the data center project which will need 24 large, long lead time components such as SMR reactors, steam generators, and related equipment.

By way of background, KED reported that the Doosan deal got traction last month when John L. Hopkins, NuScale's CEO, visited Doosan's headquarters in Korea and toured its SMR manufacturing plant. During his stay in Korea, Hopkins met with Kim Jong-du, vice president and head of the nuclear power plant business at Doosan, to discuss future projects, including equipment supply schedules.

Doosan plans to spend $219 million by the end of next year to expand and upgrade its production facilities. A Doosan executive told the Korea Economic Daily, ""Once SMR market takes off, Doosan will become the world's largest foundry player to make smaller reactors under contract.""

History of South Korean Investment in NuScale

KED reported that NuScale, in cooperation with its Korean partners, is scheduled to build Korea's first SMR in Uljin, North Gyeongsang Province. NuScale's Korean partners include GS Energy Corp., an energy unit of GS Group, and Samsung C&T Corp., a construction and engineering subsidiary of Samsung Group. GS Energy and Samsung C&T have invested $40 million and $70 million in NuScale.

On April 29, 2019, NuScale Power and Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction Co., (DHIC) Ltd. (Doosan) announced a $44M strategic cooperation to support deployment of the NuScale SMR worldwide. Doosan and its financial partners provided a cash investment in NuScale as part of this strategic relationship. In 2021, the company invested an additional $60 million into NuScale and secured an exclusive right to build core SMR equipment for the US firm.

Doosan will supply long lead time components and other equipment. DHIC is expected to bring its expertise in nuclear pressure vessel manufacturing. Doosan also signed the 'unit purchase agreement' through which it will make a cash equity investment in NuScale with Korean financial investors. The terms of the equity deal were not disclosed but it will involve transfer of NuScale stock to Doosan.

In 2023 NuScale Power announced it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) to support NuScale's small modular reactor (SMR) deployment.

In March 2023, KEXIM and NuScale signed an MOU in which they agreed to financial cooperation in support of deploying NuScale SMRs. KEXIM is the official export credit agency of Korea providing comprehensive export credit and guarantee programs to support Korean enterprises conducting overseas business. According to the announcement, the organization will explore potential opportunities to provide credit facilities to NuScale and facilitate overseas business of Doosan in collaboration with NuScale.

Competition to take gain market share for SMR designs is increasing from TerraPower LLC., X-Energy, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy and Holtec International. TerraPower is offering a 345 MWe sodium cooled advanced reactor. GE Hitachi is offering its BWRX300, a BWR type light water reactor (LWR), and Holtec is offerings is recently upgraded SMR-300 LWR type SMR.

So far, TerraPower is ahead in the race to obtain NRC approval of a new reactor design with the NRC's acceptance this month of its construction license application. (See story below). The other firms are engaged in prelicensing work with the NRC.

SK Group's holding firm SK Inc., its energy and battery affiliate SK Innovation Co. and Korea Hydro Nuclear Power Co. (KHNP) last year joined hands with TerraPower, a US SMR developer founded by Bill Gates, to cooperate on the development of next-generation nuclear power technologies. SK Group has invested $250 million in TerraPower. HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering Co. (KSOE) has invested $30 million in TerraPower as part of its push to develop nuclear power plant ships.

KHNP, Korea's state-run nuclear power operator, is working to develop a Korean-type SMR by 2030. Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. (Hyundai E&C) and its US nuclear reactor partner Holtec International are also working on an SMR design.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) a fast fission clean power technology and nuclear fuel recycling company, announced its collaboration with Wyoming Hyperscale to supply 100MW of nuclear generated elecrtrical power to a state-of-the-art data center campus.

The companies have signed a non-binding letter of intent outlining their intent to enter into a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement.

It is the second such agreement that Oklo has signed with a data center firm in recent months indicated a growing focus on the firm's interest in providing reliable and scalable clean power solutions in response to the increasing demand for electricity driven by global digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI) adoption.

In April Oklo signed a $25M deal to provide up to to 500 MW of nuclear power. The data center developer Equinix made a $25 million prepayment as part of the power purchase agreement. However, it did not take an equity stake in the firm.

Oklo's stock was hammered on the first day of trading May 9th dropping from an open of $18.23/share with a slow recovery closing on May 24th at $10.15/share. Confidence in the firm's future work with nuclear materials was boosted by its MOU on May 13th by an agreement with Idaho Falls, ID, based Atomic Alchemy to co-develop nuclear isotopes. The partnership aims to increase the production of industrial and medical isotopes vital for cancer treatment, diagnostic imaging, and clean energy technologies.

The letter of intent for Equinix intends to purchase power from Oklo's planned 'powerhouses' to serve Equinix's data centers in the US on a 20-year timeline at rates to be decided in future Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Equinix will have the right to renew and extend PPAs for additional 20-year terms. Planned locations for the data centers and their reactor power sources were not disclosed in the filing. Equinix, which has been in the data center business for over two decades, owns and operates a network of 260 International Business Exchange (IBX) data centers located in 71 major metro areas around the world

The letter provides Equinix the right of first refusal for 36 months for the output of certain powerhouses for power capacity of no less than 100MWe and up to a cumulative maximum of 500MWe.

Key Challenges for Nuclear Energy and Data Centers

The two nonbinding agreements Oklo has signed are part of a trend in which the growing demand for electricity by data centers planning to support artificial intelligence are being addressed by power purchase agreements from nuclear utilities, and, directly, from developers of nuclear reactors who are offering to build and operate power plants for customers.

Timelines Matter

The company at one time predicted it would have its first unit in operation by 2025. In an interview with Bloomberg wire service on 5/10/24, CEO Jacob DeWitte offered a revised timeline in general terms. Oklo states on its website it now plans to ship its reactors to customers ""before the end of the decade.""

""We've got regulatory work ahead of us for the next couple of years before we really transition into the heavier capital outlays for some of equipment that we'll be investing in as part of the plant and building out the plant,"" DeWitte said.

Timelines for delivery to customers of other SMRs vary depending on the technology and maturity.

In a webinar hosted last week by the American Nuclear Society, Rita Baranwal, SVP for the AP300 SMR project at Westinghouse in charge of the development and go to market strategy for the firm's new AP300 SMR, said that it could be as long as a decade before one of them produces power for its first customer. The firm announced the start of work on the SMR in May 2023. In February 2024 it announced an agreement to build four of them for a privately funded industrial consortium in the UK.

The GE-Hitachi BWRX300 which has agreements to build multiple units for the Tennessee Valley Authority at its Clinch River, TN, site, and for Ontario Power Generation at its Darlington, ON, Canada, site. An NRC license is in the future although currently the firm continues to engage with the agency via topical reports to be reviewed in prelicensing meetings. The firm completed Phases 1 & 2 of the Vendor Design Review (VDR) process at the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission in March 2023. A VDR does not involve the issuance of a license under Canada's Nuclear Safety and Control Act and is not part of the licensing process. The conclusions of the VDR do not bind or otherwise influence decisions made by the Commission.

Data Centers Tapping Nuclear Utilities for Power

The incredible growth in expected demand for power by data centers expecting to host the intensive processing power of semiconductors designed to run AI programs is focused on a much shorter timeline than for SMRs. For this reason, it is likely there will be more power purchase agreements inked with existing nuclear utilities to carve out a guaranteed supply of reliable electrical power.

For instance, in March of this year, Talen Energy announced its sale of a 960-megawatt data center campus to cloud service provider Amazon Web Services (AWS), a subsidiary of Amazon, for $650 million. The data center, Cumulus Data Assets, is located on a 1,200-acre campus in Pennsylvania and is directly powered by the adjacent Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES), which generates 2.5 GWe of power. In other words, there is no external public grid involved. The power will come via a direct private connection.

In terms of the mantra of ""data centers need power now,"" according to Talen Energy's investor presentation, it will supply fixed-price nuclear power to AWS's new data center as it is built. AWS reported to have contractual power commitments that stage in 120 MW increments over time. The firm has two 10-year extension options tied to NRC nuclear license renewals of the SSES reactor. There's plenty of time for that as the current license does not come up for renewal until July of 2042.

Microsoft signed an agreement in June 2023 with Constellation for power from its fleet of nuclear reactors to supply electricity to a data center in Boynton, VA. A similar agreement was signed by Microsoft with Ontario Power Generation (OPG) in September 2022. As part of the deal, OPG and Microsoft will explore digital co-innovation opportunities to accelerate OPG's Small Modular Reactor (SMR) program. OPG is planning to build one or more of the GE-Hitachi BWRX300 small modular reactor.

Overall, while there is great excitement about the potential for data centers to be powered by nuclear energy, large and small, the current trend is for data centers is to tap into existing nuclear utilities.

& & &

A Norwegian power company plans to build small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) for data centers in Norway to help take some of the pressure off of the country's grid/power network.

Norsk Kjernekraft (NK) says it will develop the reactors to provide private line power power connections for data centers and other industrial customers that require ""reliable power"" that are 'off-the-'grid' also known as 'behind-the-meter.'

It is in the interest of data centers to bypass regional grid connections and tap into the electric utility's generating plant with a private wire to insure uninterrupted 24X7 365 days/year power. Emergency power is then supplied by diesel generators or fuel cells.

In its press statement the firm said Google has plans in Norway that, over the next two decades, wants 840 MW of electricity for its data center in Skien. Energy Minister Terje Aasland (who comes from Skien) has said that Skien municipality must provide the power itself. The acting mayor has said that the city will consider nuclear power. The city is located 250 miles (440 km) southeast and the six hours it takes to to travel there includes a ferry ride across one of Norway's many fjords.

Aside from its northern latitude, 59:09N, 9:42E, the climate is remarkably temperate for this location between April and October. Winter months are frigid which makes for an virtually unlimited supply of cold air to cool hot data centers at least half of the year.

Norsk Kjernekraft said it can build three-to-four SMRs of 300 MWe each in connection with the data center. It will deliver 900-1200 MW of electricity (7.5-10 TWh a year) on an land area equivalent to a couple or three football stadiums. It is enough to operate the data center and, for example, a green electrolysis factory for hydrogen (where the heat can be utilized).

In addition, NK said the heat will be able to be used for the nearby Herøya industrial park located 12 miles south of Skien. Herøya Industripark is of the country's largest industrial parks. Its coastal site makes it a major port for exports. There are approximately 80 companies in the park with a total of 2,500 employees

Despite the fact that Norway's North Sea fossil fuel platforms produce two million barrels/day in oil, the country's electricity grid currently runs entirely renewable energy sources mainly provided by hydro power, which accounts for 88% of the country's supply along with wind energy adding another 10%.

The oil and gas sector continues to be a key driver for the Norwegian economy. The sector accounts for 24% of GDP, 19% of total investments, 36% of state revenues, and 52% of total exports. Between oil and gas resources, and hydro power, until now Norway has not had an inclination to develop nuclear energy power stations. There are no commercial nuclear reactors in Norway. Public perceptions about nuclear energy range from ambivalent to so-called ""green"" views that object to anything nuclear.

What to with All that Heat in Norway?

The firm says that the waste heat generated by data center's computer devices can also be harnessed for manufacturing processes and district heating systems. Norsk Kjernekraft emphasized the heat produced by the SMRs could also ""be used for heat-intensive industries.""

""It can be for the production of steel and aluminum, but also for carbon capture, as well as the production of hydrogen, ammonia, and e-fuels. The residual heat can be used for district heating. All this reduces the need for electricity, and thereby also the need for grid development.""

Although the proposal by Norsk Kjernekraft for SMRs to power data centers at Skien is still in the talking stage, the company is also proposing to build a nuclear plant made up of five SMRs in a suburb of the city of Bergen. It has signed a deal with Rolls Royce, which will supply that firm's 470 MWe PWR type reactors for the site. Rolls Royce has previously pitched its new reactor design directly to data center operators. Now NK says the plan is for data centers inking power purchase agreements with it for electricity from the Rolls-Royce reactors. Feasibility studies are currently being carried out, and the company believes the first reactor could be up and running in ten years.

Rolls-Royce is currently taking its 470 MW PWR design through the UK Office of Nuclear Regulation generic design assessment process which should be complete for the purpose of licensing it in the UK later this decade.

It is unclear to what extent a UK license would carry weight with the Norwegian nuclear safety agency which have never reviewed an entirely new commercial reactor design for safety and for the purpose of then issuing a license to build one or a fleet of them. It has licensed two small research reactors.

NuclearN.ai, announces the release of SPARK-mini, which is a large language model (LLM) trained specifically for the nuclear power domain. The firm offers the product for private, on-premise deployment.

In its press statement the firm said that the LLM is "" uniquely accessible, open for researchers and practitioners with specialized security concerns and consistently outperforms larger, more powerful models."" It added that SPARK-mini is available for download today from the Hugging Face platform.

According to the company statement, SPARK-mini is trained on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's ADAMS Public Library, which encompasses over 50 million of nuclear regulatory, technical, design, and operational records.

The LLM is intended to provide NuclearN's customer base of nuclear utilities and service providers with the ability to interpret complex nuclear terminology SPARK-mini is intended to serve the needs of practitioners and researchers that desire to build applications requiring a high degree of nuclear understanding while also offering privacy, data security, and offline accessibility.

""NuclearN's objective has always been to drive innovation within the nuclear power industry,"" says Brad Fox, CEO and Co-Founder of NuclearN.ai.

""Along with the AtomAssist platform and our technical authoring tools, we are excited to help accelerate innovation in the nuclear industry. SPARK-mini represents the first openly available nuclear-focused LLM that is small enough to be deployed in traditional IT environments, yet powerful enough to be an incredibly useful tool to accelerate technical work accurately and expediently.""

The firm also noted that the platform features 'AI hallucination' management and automated independent verifications for technical authorship. The firm offers customized solutions based on a team of nuclear industry veterans and technology experts. They provide training and support for deployment of the LLM.

Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) reports it has completed a successful demonstration using digital twin software applications to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into the management sector of nuclear power plants.

Digital twin technology, now under development for application by Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP), will enable the firm to monitor and control the country's 26 nuclear power generating units more effectively than ever before, according to the state-run company Friday.

KHNP said digital twin, a digital model of an actual physical system that serves as an digital counterpart of the physical reactor, will allow its central R&D center in Daejeon to remotely oversee the units in five nuclear power plants nationwide -- Kori, Wolsong, Hanbit, Hanul and Saeul -- and apply immediate solutions at times of unexpected situations.

The upcoming breakthrough is a revolutionary improvement from the industry's initial operations in which power plants were managed by each of their own operating systems instead of a singular organization, making the company's control over its plants inefficient and tricky.

KHNP's digital twin development is currently evolving concerning the detailed systematic blueprints of Saeul Nuclear Power Plant's units 1 and 2 in Ulsan. Its development is expected to be finished in 2026, the technology will be first deployed at Shin Kori Nuclear Power Plant's units 3 and 4 in Ulsan, where avatars will roam the facility and monitor specific parts just like a technician in real life would.

""The digital twin will allow us to simultaneously check reactor cores, turbines and generators in different power plants in a three-dimensional virtual world,"" a KHNP official said. He added that it is now in demand in the Czech Republic and Poland seeking to import our nuclear power technologies.""

The digital twin technology is part of ongoing development projects by KHNP's Artificial Intelligence Monitoring and Diagnosis (AIMD) Center in Daejeon. Having set up a complete remote command center over the power plants, the center oversees the facilities and checks for any malfunctions by detecting signs of vibrations emanating from a power plant in trouble. The magnitude of the vibrations the center can detect is so small that they are even undetectable to the plant experiencing the technical difficulty.

""The biggest strength of AI which distinguishes itself from human labor is that it can monitor a large volume of facilities simultaneously,"" the AIMD researcher said. ""It can also detect abnormal signs before any human can notice.""

KHNP is now building its latest power plants, Shin Hanul units 3 and 4, next to the now-operating units 1 and 2 in Uljin, with a cost of $7.2 billion) The APR1400, a model entirely designed by Korea, is expected to be completed in 2032 and 2033, respectively, and generate 1,400 megawatts of electricity from each unit.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) accepted TerraPower's construction permit application for review, marking the first time in more than 40 years that the NRC has docketed this type of application for a commercial non-light water reactor.

The advanced reactor company, based in Bellevue, Washington, is seeking permission to build its Natrium reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming as part of a demonstration project supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). If approved, the construction permit will be the first ever issued by the NRC for a commercial non-light water power reactor.

TerraPower's application applied new technology-inclusive guidance that was recently issued by the NRC to ensure consistency, quality, and uniformity of reviews for non-light water reactor applicants. The new guidance included an endorsement of the industry-led TICAP project (ML21272A303) to deliver a more risk-informed review of the safety analysis report. The project is an important next step in implementing the licensing modernization project, which was supported by DOE and also involves collaboration with industry and the NRC.

""We're excited to have our construction permit application docketed for review by the NRC,"" said Jeff Navin, the director of external affairs for TerraPower.

""By implementing the licensing modernization project framework, TerraPower is helping to demonstrate a more streamlined approach to licensing non-light water advanced reactors.""

The Natrium reactor is a 345MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt energy storage system that is being designed to flexibly operate with renewable power generators to help decarbonize the electric grid. The first Natrium reactor will be built in Lincoln County, WY, near the retiring Naughton coal plant -- a transition to nuclear power that could bring new economic and environmental benefits to the community. Non-nuclear construction on the project is expected to start later this summer.

TerraPower said recently it is confident its first Natrium plant will be built by 2030, but HALEU fuel supply remains a concern.",energycentral.com,news,Energy Central,,0.1607843137254903,454549170,27,,eng-9610583

The old man in his song said Nagas were born of one mother, yet they have been separated against their will"". I remember reading this at some website last year, and like the so many Nagas living in India failed to understand what the fuss was all about. Until I chanced about a collection of more than 100 colored images depicting Myanmar Nagas published by East Wind, a media house based in Delhi.

The hundred thousand Nagas living in Myanmar (Burma) mainly because of extreme poverty and almost inaccessible transportation and telecommunications have little contact with the outside world, and with the Nagas living across the border in India. What East Wind has strived through this compilation is to provide a rare peek into the very much hidden Nagas living in Myanmar (Burma) tucked away in a remote place. East Wind has managed to make the Coffee Table Book not superficial but offers a reality and evidence based information in the form of photo documentation, and not so much on how rich and colorful and rich Nagas are culturally but more on how to bring help and assistance to improve their situation, including access to communications, health care and education.

The Coffee Table Book is a stunning pictorial record of one of the most isolated, least visited, poorly represented and severely under developed ethnic people in Burma and in the region.

The Chief Minister of Nagaland Neiphiu Rio, who apparently has extended his unconditional support in making this book, writes the foreword of the book. After a grueling six months of exploring the region, East Wind stated that there is no information on the actual living conditions, the day to day livelihood, needs and concerns, hopes and aspiration, limitations and difficulties and most importantly no factual data about the people, the land resources and administration arrangements without which development plans and assistance cannot be developed. Communications, both transportation and telecommunications, is extremely poor and almost inaccessible.

The book hence provides an insight into the real condition of the Burma Nagas. With the only exposure the Burma Nagas has with the global community is during the New Year Festival held every year in the month of January. What little documentation available is mostly about the famous festival and what it offers and sadly even these limited information are poorly presented both in terms of facts and quality. So it is no surprise that most tourist attraction materials like maps, brochures, flyers and other advertisements about Burma are filled with colorful photos of the traditionally attired Nagas.

A highly recommended acquisition, be it for media persons, travelers, art enthusiasts and culture vultures. This book is a must-read for anybody who has an interest in Nagas, whether living in India or Myanmar. I recommend that everybody who plans to visit buy this book before they go. This book will prepare them for a real discovery. With art direction from Kuku Christina and Girish Mason, the book is a visual treat that couples heart wrenching and real depiction of the real face of Nagas living in Myanmar. Arhe supplied the text and video for this project.

N. Arhe meets The Morung Express: After completing her matriculation in Nagaland, she journeyed on to Mumbai, Chandigarh and then later studied at the London School of Journalism. In May 2002, she established ""East Wind"" - A bi monthly magazine focused on the Northeast region of India based in New Delhi.

Born in Kohima, Journalist/Editor, Arhe has been awarded the Young Women Achiever Award in 2007 from the National Women Network at Delhi, and in 2008 got scholarship from the parent body International Women Network to attend the Women Leadership Training programme held at Prague, Czech Republic. Besides running the publishing house, in 2009-2010, she has also initiated and successfully completed the first Street Kitchen Project, whereby every weekend hundreds of street children working at traffic lights were fed and taught basic education and personal hygiene. The project was supported by France based Trust, Mustard seed.

On the book, Arhe stated we have tried our best to present the actual reality of the people and their living conditions - the way it is"". She reflects that the trips made to Naga inhabited Myanmar areas were adventurous and definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience. She also furnishes that in the beginning, people were very suspicious of their presence while they were traveling. She allots this to the fact that people were accustomed to having visitors only during the New Year festival. However, one advantage that she and team had was the fact that some of them could speak Nagamese which came very handy, for in every village they met at least one youth who had come to study theology in Nagaland.

Arhe further furnishes that the condition of the people in villages were in deplorable conditions and in many villages' women still were not covered properly and families still lived with pigs and chicken in the same huts. ""Some villages that we visited could well be a good 40 years behind our Nagaland,"" Arhe stated.

There are few townships such as Khamti, Lahe and Layshi which is just beginning to be exposed to modern world. With new road connections, getting electricity for four hours a day and have a public phone booth that opens at specific time of the day for couple of hours. But there are the rest of the Nagas areas where modernity has not touched the people in any way. Village folks still walk for days and hours to commute from one village to another. But, the glimmer of hope is that, in the last few years' missionaries from Nagaland have started visiting them, and the presence of one Church in every village has sort of brought about some changes and awareness in the life of the village folks. In Khamoi village, which is probably the closest village from Lungwa, Mon district, we came across a school, which was set up with the help of Nagaland Baptist Church council. We also had an interesting conversation with a volunteered teacher who told us how challenging it is to convince parents to send their children to school. For most of them would rather have their children help them in the fields than waste their day sitting in a class room. Such is their mindset""

""Without trying to sound patronizing, we also came across people who said that it is only in the recent past, after the present government has come into power and with personal interest of our Chief Minister that the place has seen a glimmer of hope and a new found affection for the rest of the Naga family on the other side of the border,"" she said.

The harshest reality, Arhe says of the experience was the realization that it's a no man's land; it's like going to another world. There were also moments of utter sadness watching young children and village elders oblivious of the world outside their own. On the query about how Nagas living in Myanmar view Nagas living in India, she opined, ""Some of them are not even sure if they are living in India or Myanmar. There are many areas which are closer to India than to the rest of Myanmar, so they buy their groceries from Mon, Kiphire or other bordering areas. Also, another interesting point is that, even though they live in Myanmar, there are very few who can speak or understand Burmese.

Personally Arhe feels that she is more drawn to the children and that the main focus should be on children. ""They have no access to health care services whatsoever. For many of them the nearest hospital still means a good few hours of walking, with more than half of the Nagas villages still with no road connectivity it was heart wrenching to see a large number of children severely malnourished with distended abdomen, clearly indication of intestinal worms. These children urgently need basic health care services,"" she said.

Arhe shares that a lot of people asked her to compare Myanmar Nagas with their counterparts. To this she said, whatever backward areas we think we have in Nagaland, take those villages and those in Myanmar. It's a difference of at least couple of decades, she said. It was a reality check and completely back to basics moment for me and the team, she said.

On enquiring about the target audience for the book, She said, their main target is Schools/Institutions' that would want to keep the Coffee Table Book in their libraries. ""It's important to keep it for history and also for future reference"" This she said was her true intent.

Looking ahead, Arhe reveals that there have already been offers to do more photo book and is most likely to put out one more this year.

On her parting shot she said, ""With easier access to Naga areas, anyone with an interest in history, stories or with a spirit of adventure should visit these Naga villages in Myanmar. There are so many stories that have never had the chance to be told or heard, this is the right time to do so."" she concluded.

Background information

In Czechia, about 95% of the population has access to clean water and 86% are connected to wastewater management systems. The country also performs well in terms of efficiency and conservation. It has relatively low water losses due to damaged pipes and other infrastructure, which account for about 15% of the total water supply. In comparison to other EU countries, Czechia has a lower per capita water consumption rate. On average, each person uses about 90 litres of water per day, while the EU average is 120 litres.

EIB Group

The European Investment Bank Group consists of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF). The EIB is the long-term lending institution of the European Union. It finances sound investment contributing to EU policy goals and works closely with other EU institutions to advance shared policy priorities, like equitable growth and a just transition to climate neutrality.

All EIB projects must meet strict environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria and be aligned with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. The loan for BVK is an example of an operation that, by adhering to ESG standards, significantly contributes to the green transition. It follows another project with the city of Brno which supported sustainable biomass heating in 2023. Overall, EIB Group financing in Czechia amounted to a total of €1.88 billion last year, of which €188 million was provided through the EIF.

Czechia: EIB backs improved wastewater treatment with CZK 1.3 billion loan for city of Brno

An EIB green loan has been signed to help modernise a wastewater treatment plant in the city of Brno, Czech Republic.

The European Investment Bank (EIB) has signed a CZK 1.3 billion (about €53.2 million) loan agreement with Brněnské vodárny a kanalizace (BVK), the municipal water and wastewater company in the Czech city of Brno. The operation will upgrade the sewage sludge treatment facility of BVK's Modřice wastewater plant, thus further improving environmental protection and public services in Czechia's second biggest city.

The project will help BVK increase the amount of dried sludge produced, making it easier, more cost-effective and safer to transport and dispose of or repurpose. It will also reduce the overall volume of treated sludge, enhance the energy efficiency of the sludge treatment process, and improve the quality of the treated wastewater.

""The Czech Republic has made significant progress in water and wastewater management since joining the European Union 20 years ago,"" said EIB Vice-President Kyriacos Kakouris, who signed the loan on the sidelines of the CEE Sustainable Finance Summit in Prague. ""Supporting investments in the water sector is an EIB priority. It helps to use our natural resources more efficiently and is essential for protecting public health and for reducing our carbon footprint. Today's loan is further proof that EU support, be it financial or technical, matters for people and the environment they are living in.""

BVK Board Chair Daniel Struž said: ""The sludge management project of the Brno Modřice plant is crucial to BVK's long-term strategy of providing top-quality water and wastewater services. We very much appreciate the EIB's trust and co-financing, which confirms we are on the right track with renewing and developing strategic water infrastructure. We hope to continue this cooperation to finance future projects aligned with global environmental goals.""

BVK is one of the biggest water companies in the country. It provides water services to Brno city and several nearby towns and villages, home to a total of 415 000 people. Replacing the outdated sewage sludge facility will yield economic and social benefits. For instance, it will almost halve electricity consumption during the treatment process, substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It will also improve the environmental balance and public health and enable BVK to comply with EU wastewater laws.

Finally, the project also supports an economically weaker region, as defined by EU cohesion policy. In Czechia, more than three-quarters of EIB financing in 2023 went to raising the living standards in such regions. The project received support from EIB advisory services on the technical aspects and the tender process.

Background information

In Czechia, about 95% of the population has access to clean water and 86% are connected to wastewater management systems. The country also performs well in terms of efficiency and conservation. It has relatively low water losses due to damaged pipes and other infrastructure, which account for about 15% of the total water supply. In comparison to other EU countries, Czechia has a lower per capita water consumption rate. On average, each person uses about 90 litres of water per day, while the EU average is 120 litres.

EIB Group

The European Investment Bank Group consists of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF). The EIB is the long-term lending institution of the European Union. It finances sound investment contributing to EU policy goals and works closely with other EU institutions to advance shared policy priorities, like equitable growth and a just transition to climate neutrality.

All EIB projects must meet strict environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria and be aligned with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. The loan for BVK is an example of an operation that, by adhering to ESG standards, significantly contributes to the green transition. It follows another project with the city of Brno which supported sustainable biomass heating in 2023. Overall, EIB Group financing in Czechia amounted to a total of €1.88 billion last year, of which €188 million was provided through the EIF. Total EIB Group support over the past three decades now stands at €29.4 billion.

Brněnské vodárny a kanalizace

Brněnské vodárny a kanalizace, a.s. (BVK) has provided water services to the city of Brno for over 150 years. While the company was founded in its current form in 1992, it builds on the work of its predecessors dating back to 1872 when the Pisárky water treatment plant first began operations.

Rescued Javan pangolin in Quang Nam gives birth after six months

After birth, the baby Javan pangolin receives meticulous care, including specialized nutrition and close monitoring to ensure its healthy development.

On May 24, the leader of Quang Nam Province's Department of Natural Resources and Environment reported that a Javan pangolin individual rescued and nurtured at the Vinpearl River Safari Nam Hoi An Animal Rescue Center had successfully given birth.

Accordingly, the Javan pangolin was discovered in a severely injured state on December 13, 2023, by the Forest Protection Unit of Tien Phuoc District, Quang Nam Province. It was subsequently transferred to the center to ensure proper care and rehabilitation.

According to Mr. Le Viet Cuong, Head of the Animal Care Department at the Center, caring for the severely injured Javan pangolin caught in a trap posed significant challenges. During the rescue operation, the center conducted a scan of the pangolin to aid in treatment and discovered that it was possibly pregnant, although there were no clear signs.

The pangolin individual resides in a simulated natural habitat, featuring soil, vegetation, and hiding spots to ensure the animal feels secure and at ease. On May 13, during a routine health check, the caretakers found that the pangolin had given birth to a newborn.

""After birth, the baby Javan pangolin receives meticulous care, including specialized nutrition and close monitoring to ensure its healthy development. The baby Javan pangolin is regularly weighed and undergone medical assessments. As of now, the newborn pangolin has gained 34 grams, weighing a total of 211 grams.""

Before that, on January 22, 2023, the center celebrated the birth of a Javan pangolin offspring from an individual rescued on August 25, 2022, by the Nam Giang District Police (Quang Nam Province).

UNDP says political commitments needed for green economy

Strong political commitment from governments and active private sector engagement are critical for achieving a green and resilient economy, according to UNDP Deputy Resident Representative in Việt Nam Patrick Haverman.

""Green recovery and green economy efforts must be vigorously pursued at national, regional and global levels, guided by the SDGs and the Paris Agreement,"" he said while speaking at the South-South Lessons Learned Workshop on Aligning Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) with Green Recovery in the central province of Thừa Thiên-Huế.

In response to the dual challenges of recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and addressing climate change, the alignment of NDCs with green recovery strategies has become a vital pathway for sustainable development.

To support this goal, the UNDP initiated a targeted support project for five pilot countries -- Benin, Albania, Ecuador, Việt Nam and Jordan.

The workshop, which takes place from Wednesday to Friday, brings together government officials and UNDP international experts from the five countries as well as other Vietnamese representatives.

It aims to share insights and lessons learned from the pilot countries on integrating NDCs with green recovery initiatives.

Other objectives include identifying best practices and challenges in aligning NDCs with sustainable economic recovery efforts, exploring opportunities for applying the lessons learned in future programming and policy-making, and developing networks for South-South cooperation on NDCs and sustainable development.

The initiative focuses on leveraging the NDC enhancement and implementation process to foster a recovery that is robust, equitable and sustainable, highlighting the importance of the Paris Agreement and its instruments, such as NDCs, National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and Long-Term Strategies (LTS).

The pilot countries have undertaken various initiatives, including policy alignment, financial strategies, capacity building and knowledge sharing to integrate NDCs into their green recovery efforts.

In addition to deep-dive sessions on aligning NDC policy measures with post COVID-19 recovery plans and NDC finance with recovery finance, the workshop also includes sessions on enhancing gender responsiveness and inclusivity in green recovery efforts.

Hoàng Hải Minh, deputy chairman of Thừa Thiên-Huế Province People's Committee, said: ""With the cooperation and support of UNDP, Thừa Thiên-Huế has achieved positive results in green energy conversion, reducing carbon and methane emissions in the transportation sector.

""Some projects include the pilot 'Support for providing preferential loans for individuals to purchase electric vehicles' for people in Thừa Thiên-Huế Province; deploying six electric trucks at a pilot waste collection site in Huế City funded by UNDP; researching and testing green transportation policy for shippers delivering goods by motorbike in Huế City; and installing solar panel systems for electric vehicle charging stations.""

Workshop participants are scheduled to visit various sites in Huế City, including Vietnam Motorcycle Ltd., where they will see the electric vehicle fleet supported by UNDP. They will also visit Huế Environment and Urban Works JSC to learn about solar battery stations and electric garbage trucks funded by the Japanese government and UNDP.

Additional stops include the Institute of Development Studies of Thừa Thiên-Huế Province and a shared bicycle station promoting environmentally friendly transport options.

The tour concludes at the Gia Long Mausoleum, where participants will experience the electric vehicle and bicycle systems used for site visits.

Vietnamese women's volleyball team defeats Singapore

The Vietnamese women's volleyball team continued their winning streak in Group B of 2024 Asian Women's Volleyball Challenge Cup, with their victory over Singapore's women's team being unsurprising.

On the afternoon of May 23 in the Philippines, the Vietnamese women's volleyball team played their second group stage match in Group B, facing off against Singapore.

In theory, Singapore's women's volleyball team is not a particularly strong opponent for the Vietnamese team. Nevertheless, coach Nguyen Tuan Kiet and the coaching staff remained cautious and respectful, ensuring a solid lineup. Once again, outside hitter Tran Thi Thanh Thuy did not take the court. However, hitters Hoang Thi Kieu Trinh, Nguyen Thi Tra My, and Nguyen Thi Bich Tuyen were assigned the responsibility of scoring points by coach Nguyen Tuan Kiet.

Besides them, at certain points, outside hitters Vi Thi Nhu Quynh and Tran Tu Linh were brought in to bolster the strength of the Vietnamese women's team. Throughout the match, setter Vo Thi Kim Thoa safely distributed the ball to the outside and middle hitters, allowing Vietnamese players to make precise attacks.

In the first set, coach Nguyen Tuan Kiet's players secured a quick victory with a score of 25-8. In the second set, the Singaporean team showed more enthusiasm and determination, making it challenging for the Vietnamese blockers. At the crucial moment of the set, Bich Tuyen made a precise spike to secure a 29-27 win. The third set concluded with a decisive 25-10 victory for the Vietnamese women's volleyball team, resulting in a 3-0 overall win.

Facing a relatively weak opponent, coach Nguyen Tuan Kiet rotated players to allow more team members to play. This strategy helps each player gain a better feel for the game. In an earlier match, Hong Kong's women's volleyball team (China) defeated Indonesia 3-0. With two consecutive wins, Vietnam temporarily leads Group B. On May 24, the Vietnamese women's volleyball team will face Kazakhstan.

Vietnam's bamboo diplomacy gains Russian scholars' interest

Vietnam's bamboo diplomacy drew attention of Russian researchers on Vietnamese studies at a conference held by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) on May 22.

Participants in the event, themed ""Vietnam in a Multipolar World: Approaches, Challenges and Prospects"", discussed the concept of ""bamboo diplomacy"" in Vietnam, new directions of the Vietnamese foreign policy, the country's relations with strategic partners, its political and socio-economic development, as well as current aspects of Russian-Vietnamese cooperation.

Speaking at the conference, President of the Vietnam Union of Friendship Organisations (VUFO) Phan Anh Son briefed participants on the foreign policy that Vietnam is pursuing, which is independence, self-reliance, peace, friendship, cooperation and development, multilateralisation and diversification of foreign relations; to be a friend, a trustworthy partner and an active and responsible member of the international community; to stay steadfast in principles and goals while being flexible and smart in strategies; and to harmoniously combine the Party, state and people's external affairs.

Responding to scholars' questions about how Vietnam chooses to join international organisations, Son affirmed that following the above-mentioned principle, Vietnam will never join any organisation that hinders the development of other countries, but it has always helped others, including close neighbours, integrate into international organisations.

Talking to Vietnam News Agency, Deputy Director of the MGIMO's ASEAN Centre Valeria Vershinina said that in just the last few years, Vietnam has upgraded its relations with several powers, especially the US, to the highest level of comprehensive strategic partnership. Meanwhile, Vietnam and Russia are still maintaining their highest-level relationship successfully.

This shows that Vietnam's bamboo diplomacy is multi-dimensional and aims to maintain the country's influence and pro-activeness despite ongoing conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region as well as others in the world, she added.

For his part, Vladimir Mazyrin, Director of the Vietnam - ASEAN Research Centre at the Russian Academy of Science, held that Vietnam's philosophy of bamboo diplomacy is new and more reasonable than other countries' in the same region.

Bamboo diplomacy is not only a work methodology for Vietnam's diplomatic sector but also a right political choice in the current context, and this policy reflects Vietnamese leaders' research efforts and creativity, he added.

The concept of ""bamboo diplomany"", first mentioned by Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong at the 29th Diplomatic Conference on August 22, 2016, has become known in Russia inthe past few years and attracted growing attention.

Counsellor of the Vietnamese Embassy in Russia Doan Khac Hoang expressed his belief that better understanding of Vietnam's foreign policy will help future diplomats take the first steps properly and in a right direction to build up and develop relations between the two countries./.

Vietnam, Finland discuss ways to boost labour cooperation

Deputy Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs Le Tan Dung held a working session with Finnish Ambassador to Vietnam Keijo Norvanto in Hanoi on May 23, during which they discussed measures to promote cooperation in vocational education and sending Vietnamese workers to Finland.

Dung proposed Norvanto continue to act as a bridge to coordinate and step up cooperation activities in vocational education such as building and developing training institutions of Finland, establishing a quality assessment system that meets international standards, connecting Vietnamese vocational education institutions with Finnish businesses in Vietnam, enhancing the capacity of management officials and teachers, and selecting support for technology transfer and training courses aligned with Finland's key strengths.

While acknowledging the absence of a formal labour cooperation agreement between the two countries, Dung highlighted the recent trend of receiving Vietnamese guest workers to Finland, saying that since late 2023, about 20 Vietnamese workers have secured jobs in various sectors, including nursing, welding and forestry.

Amid the labour shortage caused by an aging population and a low birth rate, Norvanto said the Finnish Government launched the pilot Talent Boost Programme to attract workers, experts and entrepreneurs during 2020-2022 to draw 50,000 immigrants for employment to Finland by 2030 and 250,000 by 2050.

Vietnam, alongside Brazil, India, and Turkey, has been identified as a key source country for this initiative, he said.

He urged the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA) to prioritise strengthening bilateral labour cooperation, specifically by expeditiously studying and signing a Memorandum of Understanding outlining a framework for Vietnamese labourers working in Finland.

With the upcoming visit of the Finnish Minister of Employment to Vietnam in January 2025, he expressed his desire for close collaboration between MoLISA and the Finnish Embassy to solidify cooperation plans./.

HCM City partners German firms in vocational training, labour export

Le Van Thinh, Director of Ho Chi Minh City's Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, and Tran Thanh Hai, Principal of Vien Dong College, have signed a commitment with several German enterprises to increase skilled young labourers for the college and to train young talents in line with German standards for the labour market in both countries.

The signing ceremony in May 22 was part of the working trip of representatives from the municipal People's Committee to Germany to explore opportunities on transferring vocational education and training programmes at college and intermediate levels from Germany in the field of healthcare.

Under the commitment, Avestos HR UG of Germany will provide vocational training for students and assist skilled workers to integrate into the German labour market, and support in protecting their rights in Germany as defined by the programme.

Avestos also cooperate with Devis Company of Vietnam to fulfil conditions stipulated in the internship/skilled worker contract.

Meanwhile, the Vien Dong College is responsible for coordinating with Devis to provide career consultation to high school students in HCM City, and take responsibility for support programmes for its students.

The education establishment will also collaborate with relevant departments and agencies to offer recommendations to the municipal People's Committee, creating favourable conditions for sending students from HCM City to Germany for training, studying, and working.

The working trip aimed to understand the quality assurance activities according to German standards for vocational education institutions, the scope of assessment by accreditation agencies (inside and outside the scope of Germany), the acceptance of the quality assessment results of other countries, and the methods and costs of quality assurance assessments; and to learn about how vocational education institutions collaborate with businesses throughout the training process.

The delegation visited several models of elderly care centres, specialised techniques related to elderly care work.

During their stay, the delegation worked with representatives from the Consulate General of Vietnam in Frankfurt, Goethe University Hospital Frankfurt, the Azurit nursing home in Hesse, the AWO company specialising in nursing centres and schools for the elderly in Thuringia state, and the VTT company operating in teaching German to Vietnamese people in Berlin./.

Quang Binh holds memorial, reburial services for martyrs' remains

Mine action for Korea-Vietnam peace village project launched

The mine action for the Republic of Korea (RoK) - Vietnam peace village project, which covers the central provinces of Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh, was launched in Binh Dinh on May 23.

Jointly implemented by the Vietnam National Mine Action Centre (VNMAC), the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and the UN Development Programme, the project will run until December 2026 at a total cost of over 14 million USD from non-refundable aid provided by the RoK Government.

It aims to cope with consequences of bombs and mines left by the war, protect civilians, promote socioeconomic development of the localities and serve the building of rural communities of harmony, safety, prosperity and climate change resilience.

The project will focus on conducting technical surveys on 15,000 hectares of land and clear about 6,000 hectares of UXO and explosive-contaminated areas in the three provinces.

It will support UXO victims and persons with disabilities in the covered localities, while enhancing the capacity of officials at all levels in the field, and helping complete mechanisms, policies and social solutions to assist UXO victims and the disabled.

Addressing the launching ceremony, Vice Chairman of the People's Committee of Binh Dinh Nguyen Tu Cong Hoang said that 250,000 hectares, or 40% of the province's natural area are polluted by post-war bombs, mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO).

Thanks to a cooperation project between Vietnam and the RoK that was implemented in 2018-2021, more than 4,200 hectares of UXO-contaminated land of Binh Dinh were cleared, and 69,000 UXOs of all kinds were collected and deactivated. Currently, more than 26,800 people affected by UXO in the province are in need of support, Hoang said.

Sen. Lieut. Gen. Hoang Xuan Chien, Deputy Minister of National Defence, said that once completed, the project will help people in areas contaminated with bombs, mines and explosives in the three provinces to be safe during their production and daily life.

Along with the completion of three component projects implemented by the People's Committees of the three provinces, many communities and bomb and mine victims living in Hoa Binh (peace) villages will receive support in human and livelihood development, thus making an important contribution to the socio-economic development of the localities.

He asked VNMAC to continue coordinating closely with KOICA and UNDP with the highest sense of responsibility, ensuring the effective implementation of all project activities as scheduled with the utmost safety.

Earlier, VNMAC, KOICA and UNDP jointly implemented the Korea-Vietnam Mine Action Project (KVMAP) which successfully cleared nearly 17,000 hectares of UXO-polluted land in Quang Binh and Binh Dinh provinces, enhance the capacity of more than 450,000 locals in preventing UXO accidents, and support 1,000 UXO victims./.

Deputy minister requires strict handling of violations of vessel monitoring system regulations

Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Phung Duc Tien on May 23 emphasised the management of the fishing fleet, traceability, and strict administrative punishment for violations of regulations on the vessel monitoring system (VMS) as the key issues in ending illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing while addressing an online conference on May 23.

The conference was held by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) to implement Dispatch No. 49/CD-TTg on detecting and handling violations of the VMS regulations.

Tien said in a recent working session between a MARD delegation and the European Commission (EC), the EC pointed to limitations during the implementation of the VMS regulations in localities, despite adequate legal documents and strong political determination in Vietnam.

It is a must to strictly handle violations of VMS regulations, especially those committed by above-15m-long boats, the official said, noting that merely commitments or warnings are not accepted by the EC.

Ha Le, Director of the Fisheries Information Centre under the MARD's Directorate of Fisheries, said as of May 21, 2024, up to 98.25% of boats measuring at least 15m long had been equipped with VMS devices.

However, only about 60% of them maintain daily connection, he said, adding that many vessels have disconnected since 2019, which has hampered monitoring efforts by competent forces.

He also pointed to shortcomings in the handling of such violations, the loose coordination between forces in localities, along with wrongdoings by VMS suppliers.

Director of the Fisheries Resources Surveillance Department Nguyen Quang Hung asked localities to review and dispose vessels no longer operational, and take more drastic actions in investigating and handling violations./.

Vietnam calls for cooperation in protection, use of transboundary water resources

Vietnam, Slovenia, Switzerland, several other United Nations (UN) member states and international organisations on May 23 jointly organised an event on preventing attacks on water resources in armed conflicts and enhancing civilian protection.

Held within the UN Protection of Civilians Week, the event saw many representatives lauding the importance of Resolution 2573, which is on protecting objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, to the protection of water systems and infrastructure. The document was initiated by Vietnam during its non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council for 2020 - 2021.

In his remarks, Ambassador Dang Hoang Giang, Permanent Representative of Vietnam to the UN, outlined several proposals by the Southeast Asian nation for better protecting water resources in armed conflicts.

He said addressing the root causes of conflicts is the best way to protect civilians and water resources, with the Security Council playing a crucial role. Resolution 2573 is one of the significant initiatives in this regard and its implementation needs to be strengthened.

All parties involved in armed conflicts must adhere to international law and international humanitarian law and be held accountable for attacks on water resources and water infrastructure, he noted.

The diplomat went on to stress a need to prioritise stronger cooperation in protecting and sustainably using transboundary water resources to ensure effective and equitable management of the shared resources, maintaining a peaceful and stable environment for sustainable development, and preventing conflicts. The UN and regional mechanisms have a vital role to play in promoting dialogue and joint work among countries for common development and prosperity./.

""With our renewed support for the Investing in Women initiative, Australia reaffirms our commitment to advancing gender equality and accelerating inclusive economic opportunities in Vietnam and the region,"" said Andrew Goledzinowski, Australian Ambassador to Vietnam.

Australia's Ambassador for Gender Equality, Stephanie Copus Campbell AM, offered the following remarks during her official visit to Vietnam.

""It has been truly inspiring to learn about Vietnam's progress in accelerating women's economic empowerment. Australia is proud to work with Vietnam on this journey towards equality, paving the way for a more inclusive future that harnesses the talents and contributions of all.""

At the launch ceremony, representatives from private sector companies, development organisations and academia discussed the trends, priorities, and collective action needed to drive gender equality and women's economic empowerment in Vietnam.

To date, Investing in Women has provided technical support to the Government of Vietnam for the gender-transformative Labour Code of 2019, supported local partners to deliver campaigns promoting positive examples of gender equality, and collaborated with impact investors to support women-led small to medium enterprises.

Investing in Women will build on the momentum achieved, with a focus on advancing workplace gender equality, expanding the care economy, supporting campaigns on gender equality at work and at home, and fostering gender lens investing.

Investing in Women is a multi-country Australian Government initiative in Southeast Asia that seeks to accelerate women's economic empowerment. With a focus on addressing structural barriers, the initiative supports women to thrive in the workplace and succeed in business, fostering inclusive economic growth and development.

Vietnam calls for cooperation in protection, use of transboundary water resources

Vietnam, Slovenia, Switzerland, several other United Nations (UN) member states and international organisations on May 23 jointly organised an event on preventing attacks on water resources in armed conflicts and enhancing civilian protection.

Held within the UN Protection of Civilians Week, the event saw many representatives lauding the importance of Resolution 2573, which is on protecting objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, to the protection of water systems and infrastructure. The document was initiated by Vietnam during its non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council for 2020 - 2021.

In his remarks, Ambassador Dang Hoang Giang, Permanent Representative of Vietnam to the UN, outlined several proposals by the Southeast Asian nation for better protecting water resources in armed conflicts.

He said addressing the root causes of conflicts is the best way to protect civilians and water resources, with the Security Council playing a crucial role. Resolution 2573 is one of the significant initiatives in this regard and its implementation needs to be strengthened.

All parties involved in armed conflicts must adhere to international law and international humanitarian law and be held accountable for attacks on water resources and water infrastructure, he noted.

The diplomat went on to stress a need to prioritise stronger cooperation in protecting and sustainably using transboundary water resources to ensure effective and equitable management of the shared resources, maintaining a peaceful and stable environment for sustainable development, and preventing conflicts. The UN and regional mechanisms have a vital role to play in promoting dialogue and joint work among countries for common development and prosperity./.

Cu Lao Cham - Hoi An marks 15th anniversary of world biosphere reserve status

A ceremony was held by the People's Committee of Hoi An city, the central province of Quang Nam, on May 23 to mark 15 years since Cu Lao Cham - Hoi An was recognised as a world biosphere reserve by UNESCO.

Cu Lao Cham - Hoi An was granted the status by the International Coordinating Council of the Man and the Biosphere Programme of UNESCO on May 26, 2009 thanks to its unique and typical values that cannot be found anywhere else among the 11 world biosphere reserves in Vietnam at present.

Among those prominent values, the site, established in 2006, is part of the system of national-level protected areas. It features Hoi An Ancient Town - a cultural heritage site recognised by UNESCO in 1999, a nipa palm forest ecosystem in the mouth of the Thu Bon River, a special-use forest on Cu Lao Cham Island, a coastal protection forest system, and traditional craft villages with outstanding tangible and intangible cultural values associated with the land and people of Hoi An throughout history.

According to UNESCO, this biosphere reserve is a typical and the clearest demonstration of the connection and harmony between the nature and humans. Located in the downstream Thu Bon River and linked with Cu Lao Cham archipelago, it is home to all representatives of natural ecosystems along river branches, in coastal areas, and on islands around Hoi An Ancient Town.

The world biosphere reserve title is the international community's recognition of Hoi An city's remarkable efforts in preserving and bringing into play values of natural and human resources on the path to sustainable development.

On this occasion, visitors to Cu Lao Cham between May 22 - June 3 have a chance to experience diverse and special activities such as a photo exhibition on the reserve's biodiversity and nature protection efforts, a music show, and local traditional crafts./.

Vietnamese, Czech communist parties eye to strengthen relations

Chairwoman of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) of the Czech Republic Katerina Konecna has asserted her support for further strengthening the bilateral relations with Vietnam, as the two countries are looking forward to the 75th founding anniversary of the bilateral diplomatic relations (February 2, 1950 - 2025).

In a recent interview granted to the Vietnam News Agency, the official highlighted the long-lasting and good relationship between the two countries, saying that the Czech Republic was one of the first countries in the world to establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam, and even before that, it supported Vietnam's struggle for national liberation.

Throughout the history, the relationship between the two countries has always developed dynamically and comprehensively, she said.

According to Konecna, one of the foundations for strengthening bilateral relations is the mutual respect of sovereignty and choice of social models, including differences in history and culture, thus paving the way for enhancing the win-win cooperation based on the demands and capabilities of the two nations.

She stated that as a member of the European Parliament (EP), she personally always supports strengthening the relationship between the European Union (EU) and Vietnam.

In the overall bilateral relationship, she valued the long-standing tradition of the relationship between the KSCM and the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), saying that the two parties share a common belief in building a socialist society with the unique identities of each nation.

She affirmed the CPV's role in the struggle for national liberation and reunification, and as well as the ongoing national construction and defence efforts.

Konecna spoke highly of the Vietnamese community's integration into Czech society, and the fact that hundreds of thousands of people in Vietnam still maintain ties with the Czech Republic. She emphasised that the KSCM supports the recognition of the Vietnamese community as an ethnic minority group in the country more than 10 years ago.

In mid-April, during a meeting with Vietnamese Ambassador to the Czech Republic Duong Hoai Nam, Konecna evaluated the political and diplomatic relations between the two countries, stressing that the traditional friendship and multifaceted cooperation have been maintained and developed by leaders of both nations over nearly 75 years.

She affirmed KSCM's consistent policy of promoting traditional relations with communist parties around the world, of which the CPV is one of the priority partners in the foreign policy of the KSCM.

Vietnam puts forward initiatives to promote Asia's role and sustainable development

Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Le Minh Khai delivered a speech at the 29th Future of Asia Forum in Tokyo, Japan, on May 23, putting forward a number of initiatives to promote Asia's role and sustainable development amidst global complications.

He said Asia remains a dynamic and steady growth region, citing the fact that after each crisis in the past three decades, Asia has overcome difficulties, resolved challenges, developed more strongly and truly become a role model of development with pioneers and leaders in many new fields.

To promote its role and development in the future, he said it's necessary for Asia to maintain a peaceful and stable environment as a premise for cooperation and development, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, especially the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

In his viewpoint, benefits from trade and investment liberalization are distributed widely and equally among countries, and countries uphold multilateralism and take a global, all-people, comprehensive approach in solving common challenges.

The Deputy Prime Minister called on regional partners to promote and strengthen the adaptive capacity and resilience of Asian economies and businesses. According to him, through multilateral frameworks, regional economies need to increase information sharing, coordinate macro policies, and promptly promote regional and inter-regional economic cooperation initiatives.

Cooperation on food security, energy security, cyber security and trade connections to diversify supply sources is necessary to contribute to strengthening the economic security of the Asian region, he stressed.

He also suggested bringing into full play resources to promote new growth drivers in the green economy and digital economy, saying regional economies need to prepare to welcome new development trends, such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and new energy; pilot and replicate green, circular, and sharing economy models; and enhance the implementation of regional initiatives such as Japan's Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) initiative; the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement, the ASEAN Blue Economy Framework, and the ASEAN Strategy for Carbon Neutrality.

To do this, the Deputy Prime Minister requested that developed countries continue paying attention to and providing support to developing countries in terms of finance, technology transfer, and improving capacity building to implement commitments on green growth, emission reduction, climate change adaptation, and human resources training.

Amidst common challenges in the region, the Vietnamese leader called on businesses to accompany the governments in implementing its commitment to sustainable development, towards long-term economic, environmental and social goals. He underscored the need to increase investment in science - technology, and human capital, and in building inclusive, self-reliant communities, considering this an opportunity for Asian businesses to establish positions in global supply chains.

The Deputy Prime Minister expressed his hope that leaders would support youth exchange programmes to strengthen mutual understanding and build up trust for the next generations.

He also highly appreciated Japan's role in shaping Asia's future development, saying as one of the most developed economies in the region, Japan has made important contributions to regional cooperation and development over the past decades. He expected that Japan, with its advantages in capital, technology and governance, would continue to play a leading role in promoting regional economic cooperation and development, as well as supporting and accompanying partners in Asia and ASEAN on this journey.

At the meeting, Deputy PM Khai affirmed that Vietnam is part of the great Asian family, and it wishes to further promote its role as a good friend, a reliable partner, and a responsible member of the region and the international community.

He briefed delegates on Vietnam's recent development achievements and its policy line, saying the country is entering a new stage of development with the vision of becoming a developed economy by 2045.

To realise the goal, he said Vietnam focuses on implementing three strategic breakthroughs, namely economic institutions, infrastructure and human resources; steadfastly building an independent, self-reliant economy closely linked to deep, active and effective international integration; and persistently implementing the foreign policy line of independence, self-reliance, peace, friendship, cooperation and development, along with multilateralization and diversification of foreign relations.

He also assured that the Government of Vietnam accompanies foreign investors to iron out snags for win-win results.

Deputy PM meets Cambodian, Singaporean counterparts in Tokyo

Deputy Prime Minister Le Minh Khai met bilaterally with his Cambodian and Singaporean counterparts on May 23 during his working trip to Tokyo for the 29th International Conference on the Future of Asia.

Meeting Cambodian Deputy PM Sun Chanthol, Khai expressed his delight at the stable development of bilateral cooperation, especially in the economic aspect with a remarkable growth in two-way trade in the first quarter of this year.

He affirmed Vietnam's respect for Cambodia's legitimate interests in national construction and development, including the Funan Techo canal project, in line with the friendly relations and relevant regulations of the Mekong River Commission (MRC).

In this spirit, Khai urged Cambodia to continue collaborating closely with Vietnam and the MRC to share information and assess the project's impact on water resources and the eco-environment in the Mekong River basin. This, he stressed, is crucial for harmonising interests of riparian countries for the sustainable development of the basin and the well-being of its inhabitants.

Sun Chanthol, for his part, highlighted the need to further strengthen economic, trade and investment ties to achieve the goal of US$20 billion in two-way trade, adding that the Cambodian Government encourages Vietnamese investment in Cambodia.

Both leaders agreed to promote high-level visits and exchanges, including via the Party channel, and effectively implement existing agreements and cooperation mechanisms. They affirmed their high regard and priority for the fine neighbourliness, traditional friendship, comprehensive, sustainable and long-term cooperation between Vietnam and Cambodia.

Meeting with his Singaporean counterpart Gan Kim Yong, Khai congratulated Gan on his recent appointment. He believed that following the recent successful power transfer, the Singaporean Government and people will reap greater successes in national construction and development.

To elevate Vietnam-Singapore relations to a new level, Khai proposed further strengthening the implementation of the Vietnam-Singapore Economic Connectivity Agreement framework and the Digital Economy and Green Economy Partnership (GDEP) framework. He also called for attracting high-quality foreign investment in emerging technology sectors, transforming Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Parks (VSIPs) into smart, green and sustainable models, and fostering collaboration in education, training, tourism and people-to-people exchanges.

The Vietnamese leader hoped that both countries would continue working closely together at international and regional forums such as ASEAN, the United Nations, and APEC. He also emphasised the need for a strong, united and resilient ASEAN Community to uphold its role and address regional issues.

Both sides acknowledged the positive outcomes of their cooperation, particularly in the economic sphere. They expressed a commitment to elevating their relationship to a new height, potentially setting a model for future ASEAN partnerships.

Gan underscored the potential for further economic cooperation, expressing a desire to expand collaboration not just in quantity but also in quality. Building upon the GDEP framework, he suggested the two sides explore and launch projects in emerging areas like electricity transmission, hydrogen energy, carbon credits and green finance.

On the occasion, Deputy PM Khai conveyed an invitation from Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh for a visit by Singaporean PM Lawrence Wong.

HCM City contest seeks innovative solutions for public administration

Chí Thạnh Railway Tunnel expected to reopen in the next three days following landslide incident

The Ministry of Transport says that provided the remains favourable, the landslide repairs at Chí Thạnh Railway Tunnel in the south-central province of Phú Yên can be completed quickly and the tunnel reopened within the next three days.

Repairs are underway at the Chí Thạnh tunnel, with nearly 100 workers actively pumping concrete to reinforce the landslide points, while no new soil and rock displacements have been observed inside the tunnel.

Speaking at the on-site inspection on Thursday, Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyễn Danh Huy stated that Chí Thạnh Tunnel and other tunnels in the central region were built over a hundred years ago and have deteriorated.

However, due to the lack of investment funds, repairs and renovation of the tunnel faces many difficulties.

The cause of the landslide at Chí Thạnh Railway Tunnel has been identified as complicated geology and loose structures, while a road on top of the tunnel has caused structural damage.

Heavy rainfalls have reduced the physical and mechanical properties of the soil, triggering the landslide along a 325m railway tunnel section in Tuy An District and disrupting the North-South rail services.

The Ministry of Transport has instructed the Project Management Board No85, the project owner and the construction unit to closely coordinate with the Việt Nam Railway Corporation to carry out the repairs.

Construction forces must remain on-site around the clock to quickly address the landslide, ensuring worker safety throughout the process.

Despite the challenging conditions, repair work at Chí Thạnh Railway Tunnel is making significant progress.

At 10.30 am on Tuesday, a landslide occurred inside the tunnel, causing 30 cu.m of soil and rock to fall onto the track, covering part of the tunnel.

No trains were damaged, as the tunnel was already closed for reinforcement when the landslide occurred. Passengers were taken by bus to bypass the affected area.

Previously, the Bãi Gió railway tunnel in the Đèo Cả area of south-central province Khánh Hoà experienced a serious landslide, causing disruptions on the North-South railway route for nearly ten days.",vietnamnet.vn,news,VietNamNet News,,0.223529411764706,454303696,11,https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2024/5/24/vietnam-news-headlines-may-252024-c6b22b45e70c4cbf9a67d78e1d0b1f72-2951.webp?width=0&s=4I8aW7Yo_qiwMgqdsLaziw,

""3 days

His lack of social media presence prior to the post seemed to indicate that the fighter was training without electricity or food during the days of his absence. But in his typical style, it was truly unclear whether the three-day fast from food and power was about to happen or had already happened.

""Preparation can start NOW,"" he added, alluding to that idea he was training in order to prepare for more training. It also could have been a clue that he may have another fight booked.

The company, one of the pioneers in the field of climate technology investments in Central and Eastern Europe, participated in Balkan Energy Forum 2024, which gathered 500 participants from 30 countries.

Director of janom Energy and Battery Matej Šanta was a speaker on a panel on accelerating energy storage investments in the region.

Andrej Sršeň said it is a private equity group investing in renewable energy sources, battery storage, and innovative energy solutions.

Over the last two decades, the company has been operating in Central Europe, the Nordics and Finland.

""Therefore, we take BEF 2024 not only as an opportunity to invest into local projects, but also to share our knowledge and address the challenges the sector is facing,"" Sršeň stressed.

Conference participants get how important these topics are for their countries

By increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix and developing battery storage capacity, the Western Balkans are doing good things not only for the environment, but also for themselves because they are strengthening energy security, in his view.

At the same time, they are contributing to cheaper energy generation and the creation of modern and exciting jobs while attracting foreign direct investments as investors require clean and local electricity, Sršeň explained.

""We feel that the conference participants get how important these topics are for their countries. So we hope that we can do our part as an investor and mentor of local developers of the projects,"" he noted.

The future 30 MW photovoltaic facility in Croatia is the firm's first-ever investment in the country. It is eyeing other wind and PV projects in Croatia with an estimated overall capacity of over 200 MW, which will require investing an estimated EUR 300 million.

The company has long followed the renewables development potential in Croatia, Sršeň said when the project was announced.

Janom Investments was established in Slovakia in 2008. It operates several solar and hydropower plants in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The company developed wind farms Tyrinselkä and Soidinmäki in Finland, with a combined capacity of 70 MW, and later sold them to Aquila Capital.

It also invests in climate technologies.

Reporting Criteria Scope This document outlines the basis of preparation for our ESG performance indicators ('KPI's) which are available on investors.vodafone.com/esgaddendum. In preparing the ESG-related information and KPIs, Vodafone has made a number of key judgements, estimations and assumptions. The processes, methodologies and topics involved are complex. The ESG data, models and methodologies used are often relatively new, are rapidly evolving and are not of the same standard as those available in the context of financial information, nor are they subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, comparable benchmarks, or globally accepted accounting principles. It is not possible to rely on historical data as a strong indicator of future trajectories, in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models and methodologies are also likely to be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess, and we expect industry guidance, standards, market practice and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. We also face challenges in relation to the ability to access data on a timely basis and the lack of consistency and comparability between data that is available. This means the ESG-related forward-looking statements, information and targets discussed in our Annual Report carry an additional degree of inherent risk and uncertainty. In light of uncertainty as to the nature of future policy and market response to climate change and other ESG-related topics, including between regions, and the effectiveness of any such response, and as market practice and data quality and availability

develops, Vodafone may have to update the models and/or methodologies it uses, or alter its approach to ESG analysis and may be required to amend, update and recalculate its ESG disclosures and assessments in the future, its ESG ambitions, goals, commitments and/or targets or its evaluation of its progress towards its ESG ambitions, goals, commitments and/or targets. Restatements of ESG data may mean it is not reconcilable or comparable year on year. With the exception of the metrics outlined in the Assurance section, the information contained within this document and our ESG Addendum, collectively our ESG data, has not been independently verified or assured. All the information included in our ESG data has been taken from sources which we deem reliable. While all reasonable care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of the data, Vodafone has not arranged for independent verification of the data with respect to its accuracy or completeness. Further information on methodologies is included in the reporting methodology sections of this document. This report includes information on: - Operating companies in the countries where we had operational control during the year 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024: Albania, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Turkey, UK and Vodacom Group and its subsidiaries in the DRC, Egypt, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania; and - Shared operations in Albania, Egypt, Hungary, India, Romania and Spain known as Vodafone Intelligent Solutions ('_VOIS') and other group operations including Vodafone Business and Vodafone Automotive.

This report excludes information on the following unless otherwise stated in the exceptions section below: - Joint ventures where Vodafone does not have operational control: VodafoneZiggo in the Netherlands, TPG Telecom in Australia, Vodafone Idea in India and Vantage Towers and its subsidiaries in Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Romania and Spain; - Associates where we do not have operational control: Safaricom in Kenya and Ethiopia, and Indus Towers in India; - Partner Market networks in which Vodafone neither has any equity interests nor holds an operating license, including those Partner Markets that operate under the Vodafone brand; - Countries in which we are required to hold an operating licence in order to provide local customer support to multinational enterprise customers but where we neither own nor operate any licensed telecommunications network infrastructure; and - Retail stores that are Vodafone-branded by way of franchise and exclusive dealer arrangements but are not owned or operated by Vodafone.

Exceptions to the reporting scope: - Our joint ventures and associates where we don't have operational control which are included in our Scope 3 GHG emissions based on our ownership as at 31 March 2024; - Retail stores where we don't have operational control which are included in our Scope 3 GHG emissions, - M-Pesa customer numbers, which includes 100% of our associate Safaricom in Kenya and Ethiopia; and - V-hub unique user number and target, which include 100% of our joint venture VodafoneZiggo in the Netherlands. Portfolio changes The inclusion or exclusion of data from subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates that have been acquired or sold, or where there is a change in control or ownership that results in a change in operational control (as defined in the GHG Protocol), is determined by the date that the transaction in question is formally concluded with all approvals received. The impact of transactions completed in the year ended 31 March 2023 are detailed in the methodology for each metric in this document. There have been no transactions completed during the year ended 31 March 2024. The impact of transactions announced but not yet completed are reflected as performance from discontinued operations. When those transactions complete we will restate our data in accordance with the above policy.

Under 'IFRS 5 - Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations' our operations in Italy and Spain have been classified as discontinued operations and are reported as such in our financial statements. All other Group activities are reported as continuing operations. This disaggregation has also been reflected in our ESG reporting across all reporting periods. In a limited number of circumstances, data granularity was not available to disaggregate the information relating to discontinued operations. Where this is the case it is noted in the ESG Addendum in relevant footnotes to the data. Estimates and Assumptions The reported information on our operations is based on actual performance data for the period. Where actual data is not available, we have used estimates or assumptions based on actual trends. More information on these estimates or assumptions is set out in the reporting methodology sections for each metric. Data This document includes selected ESG data which should be read alongside the full ESG dataset in our ESG Addendum.

Assurance: Independent Limited Assurance Report to Vodafone Group Plc KPMG LLP (""KPMG"" or ""we"") were engaged by Vodafone Group plc (""Vodafone"") to provide limited assurance over the Selected Information described below for the year ended 31 March 2024. Our conclusion Based on the work we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Selected Information has not been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. This conclusion is to be read in the context of the remainder of this report, in particular the inherent limitations explained below and this report's intended use. Selected Information The scope of our work includes only the information included within the External ESG Assurance table on page 55 of Vodafone's Annual Report and Accounts and in Vodafone's ESG Addendum marked with the symbol ^ (""the Report"") for the year ended 31 March 2024 (""the Selected Information"") and also listed in Appendix 1. We have not performed any work, and do not express any conclusion, over any other information that may be included in the Report or displayed on Vodafone's website for the current period or for previous periods unless otherwise indicated. Reporting Criteria The Reporting Criteria we used to form our judgements is the ESG Addendum Methodology as set out at

Our responsibilities Our responsibility is to plan and perform our work to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Information has been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria and to report to Vodafone in the form of an independent limited assurance conclusion based on the work performed and the evidence obtained. Assurance standards applied We conducted our work in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000 Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (""ISAE (UK) 3000"") issued by the Financial Reporting Council and in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions information included within the Selected Information, in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (""ISAE 3410""), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Those standards require that we obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence on which to base our conclusion.

https://www.vodafone.com/about-vodafone/reporting- centre/sustainability-reports (""the Reporting Criteria""). The Selected Information needs to be read together with

the Reporting Criteria. Inherent limitations

The nature of non-financial information; the absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw; and the methods and precision used to determine non-financial information, allow for different, but acceptable evaluation and measurement techniques and can result in materially different measurements, affecting comparability between entities and over time. The Reporting Criteria has been developed to assist Vodafone in providing the Selected Information only. As a result, the Selected Information may not be suitable for another purpose. Directors' responsibilities The Directors of Vodafone are responsible for: - designing, operating and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Selected Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; - selecting and/or developing objective Reporting Criteria; - measuring and reporting the Selected Information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria; and - the contents and statements contained within the Report and the Reporting Criteria.

Independence, professional standards and quality control We comply with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (""ICAEW"") Code of Ethics, which includes independence, and other requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour, that are at least as demanding as the applicable provisions of the IESBA Code of Ethics. The firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1 Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Summary of work performed A limited assurance engagement involves planning and performing procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to obtain a meaningful level of assurance over the Selected Information as a basis for our limited assurance conclusion. Planning the engagement involves assessing whether the Reporting Criteria are suitable for the purposes of our limited assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on our judgement, on our understanding of the Selected Information and other engagement circumstances, and our consideration of areas where material misstatements are likely to arise.

The procedures performed included: - conducting interviews with Vodafone's management to obtain an understanding of the key processes, systems and controls in place over the preparation of the Selected Information; - selected limited substantive testing, including agreeing a selection of the Selected Information to source documentation; - considering the appropriateness of the carbon conversion factor calculations and other unit conversion factor calculations used by reference to widely recognised and established conversion factors; - reperforming a selection of the calculations used to prepare the Selected Information; - performing analytical procedures over a selection of the Selected Information, including a comparison to the prior period having due regard to changes in the business; and - reading the narrative accompanying the Selected Information in the Report with regard to the Reporting Criteria, and for consistency with our findings. The work performed in a limited assurance engagement varies in nature and timing from, and is less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

Our work did not include testing the accuracy of the purchase volumes in Vodafone's Supply Chain IT system and Devices dataset, which were used in calculating Total Scope 3 GHG

emissions (million tonnes CO 2 e). This report's intended use

Our report has been prepared for Vodafone solely in accordance with the terms of our engagement. We have consented to the publication of our report in Vodafone's ESG Addendum for the purpose of Vodafone showing that it has obtained an independent assurance report in connection with the Selected Information. Our report was designed to meet the agreed requirements of Vodafone determined by Vodafone's needs at the time. Our report should not therefore be regarded as suitable to be used or relied on by any party wishing to acquire rights against us other than Vodafone for any purpose or in any context. Any party other than Vodafone who obtains access to our report or a copy and chooses to rely on our report (or any part of it) will do so at its own risk.

Greenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions Reporting Criteria GHG emissions are calculated in millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (million tonnes CO 2 e) and reported in accordance with the GHG Protocol Standards, UK Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting ('SECR') requirements, RE100 Technical Guidance and the Carbon Disclosure Standards Board ('CDSB') framework. We have applied the operational control approach for the accounting of our GHG emissions and the scope of the data collected is based on this method. This is defined as operations where we have control over how energy is being used (and therefore associated services). Emissions from operations where we do not have operational control but have a financial interest i.e. shareholding, or are part of our wider value chain (e.g. suppliers) where we do not have a financial interest, are accounted for within our Scope 3 GHG emissions. Standards and guidance Our methodology for the reporting of GHG emissions has been developed using the following standards and guidance: GHG Protocol standards and guidance, including the Corporate Standard (revised edition); Scope 2 Guidance and Scope 3 Calculation Guidance; and Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard; RE100 Technical Criteria (December 2022); and The Climate Disclosure Standards Board Climate Change Reporting Framework (January 2022).

Digital technology has a huge role to play in enabling the climate transition; helping reduce carbon emissions and underpinning climate adaptation technologies. Recognising that technology can create its own impact on our climate and nature, we strive to minimise the environmental footprint of our operations, value chain and products and services. Reducing our environmental impact and helping to decarbonise society is an integral part of Vodafone's purpose. This year, the need for a green digital transition became ever-more urgent, as the global climate and energy crises deepened. We are working towards achieving reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2040 across our global operations. We continue to drive energy efficiency in our operations and seek to match our energy with electricity from renewable sources. Digital technology has been recognised as a key enabler of carbon savings. We work with our business customers to build solutions reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower their planetary impact. As use of technology expands, we are playing our part in the growing circular economy. We aim to minimise the impact of the waste we create from our own operations and encourage greater re-use, repair and recycling of the hardware our customers use.

Portfolio changes We include performance data from newly acquired businesses at the end of their first full year of new ownership in line with our policy on reporting environmental data. In terms of setting a revised baseline to reflect acquisitions, disposals or a change of control, our policy is determined as follows: - Acquisitions are built into the baseline using either actual or estimated data at the end of their first full year of ownership based on our assessment of operational control; - Disposals are removed from the baseline in the year of disposal if part of the Group for less than six months or in the following year if part of the Group for more than six months; - Where prior year data has been re-stated to correct any significant errors identified this will be noted along with the reason for re-statement; and - Where there is an update to the calculation methodology that causes a significant change in the previously stated data all prior year information will be restated. This year we have restated our GHG emissions across all prior periods to our 2020 baseline to reflect: - Disposals of Hungary and Ghana on 31 January 2023 and 20 February 2023 respectively; and - The change in control of the Vantage Towers Group on 23 March 2023 from a subsidiary to a joint venture. On 13 December 2022 ownership of Egypt was transferred to the Vodacom Group. Comparative information has been re-presented to reflect the move of Vodafone Egypt from the 'Other markets' segment to the Africa segment from 1 April 2023.

Data gathering process and methods Energy usage data is based on invoices from our energy suppliers, which in some cases include the supplier's estimated readings. Increasingly, we measure our energy consumption through smart metering, a technology that uses mobile communications to collect real-time consumption data from energy meters. Under this approach we have accounted for 100% of emissions from the operations over which we have operational control within the Scope 1 and 2 footprints. We report on data collected using local market actual or estimates sourced from invoices, purchasing requisitions or direct data measurements. Emissions from our joint ventures and associates are accounted for within our Scope 3 GHG emissions. Where actual data is not available for the full reporting period, data for the missing period is estimated using an appropriate and reasonable estimation method (for example, extrapolation using the year-to-date monthly average, or based on prior year data for the corresponding time period). Due to a time lag in the availability of actual data, the majority of GHG emissions data has been estimated for the month of March 2024. If in our future year reporting the reconciliation of estimated data against actual data identifies a material error we will restate our reporting in accordance with our policy for restatement.

Scope 1 GHG emissions These are emissions from operations under our operational control and include those from: - Diesel, petrol and other fuel used by cars and commercial vehicles owned by Vodafone or leased for six months or more; - Natural gas and other heating fuels used for space heating and hot water in our premises; - Diesel and petrol used for generators in off-grid areas, or where back-up capacity is required; and - Fugitive releases of refrigerants or fire suppressants used for air-conditioning or fire control systems in network buildings and offices. Conversion factors from the UK government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy have been used to calculate GHG emissions from other fuel sources such as diesel, petrol, natural gas and fuel oil as well as those from vehicles. Scope 2 GHG emissions These are emissions from electricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased to power our networks, technology centres, offices and retail stores. We report two different Scope 2 emission values: one using a 'market-based' method and one using a 'location-based' method. The market-based method applies if we have operating companies in any countries where energy certificates or supplier- specific information are available. The method involves using an emissions factor that is specific to the electricity purchased. The location-based method involves using an average emissions

Market-based emissions Emissions are calculated using a kWh to CO 2 e conversion factor based on one of the following sources (in order of the GHG Protocol hierarchy): - Supplier conversion factors specific to our contract; these include some markets where supplies are 100% renewable, and where we have sought evidence of singularity of supply; - Residual mix figures for 2022 - where the conversion factor reflects the removal of certificates, contracts and supplier- specific factors claimed by other organisations; and - Location-based conversion factors as described below. Location-based emissions Emissions are calculated using a kWh to CO 2 e conversion factor provided in the 2023 International Energy Agency ('IEA') emissions factor database which uses data for the 2022 calendar year where available (2021 is used if not available). For the calculation of emissions from district heating in Germany the Department for Food and Rural Affairs ('DEFRA') emissions factor is applied. The emission factor for South Africa has been restated across all reported periods to apply the factor provided by the state-owned electricity provider to more accurately reflect the emissions.

factor that relates to the grid on which energy consumption occurs. This usually relates to a country-level electricity, and where applicable district heating or cooling, emissions factor.

Renewable electricity We consider grid electricity to be purchased from renewable sources if the grid electricity used in our operation is matched with renewable energy certificates ('RECs'). RECs certify that power has been generated and added to the grid from a renewable source such as wind, solar or hydro. In addition, we purchase a growing proportion of our electricity directly from renewable generators through Power Purchase Agreements ('PPAs'). We also generate a small proportion of the electricity we use ourselves, for example through rooftop solar panels. In some of the European countries where we operate, markets for purchasing renewable electricity (traceable using RECs) are not available. We match electricity used in these countries with RECs originating from grid-connected neighbouring markets. This means that the electricity used by our network in Europe is 100% matched with renewable sources. The European markets where we match the grid electricity we use with RECs for the financial year ending 31 March 2024 are: Albania, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom. Renewable electricity includes all renewable electricity from third-party suppliers which is traceable to Vodafone through a signed contract or provision of surrendered RECs. Renewable electricity excludes RECs passed on and retired by a third party.

Scope 3 GHG emissions The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard defines 15 categories of Scope 3 emissions. All 15 categories have been assessed for inclusion within our reporting, where categories are excluded because there are no emissions, this is reviewed annually to ensure it remains valid and as part of our continued efforts to improve transparency and completeness of disclosure for our total GHG emissions footprint. We are committed to continual improvement in the quality and completeness of our Scope 3 emissions data inventory. We partner with carbon accounting specialists at The Carbon Trust to model and calculate our annual Scope 3 emissions. The Carbon Trust are experts in sustainability and carbon reporting who support us in identifying improvements to the completeness and accuracy of the input datasets and making improvements to methodology in line with emerging industry best practice. This year we have completed a review of our methodologies resulting in restatement of our Scope 3 emissions for all reported periods. This was undertaken to improve our data quality and estimation approach alongside the need to reflect portfolio changes and latest developments in industry standards and emission factors. The methodological changes made this year are considered to be insignificant.

As the methodology for measuring Scope 3 GHG emissions is still developing and industry standards may change, we will continue to evolve our methodology, and this may result in in a need to amend or update our disclosures and/or our ESG ambitions, goals, commitments and/or targets or our evaluation against these. We calculate our emissions for upstream and downstream transportation and distribution using a hybrid approach of spend-based and product specific data, which does not differentiate between upstream and downstream transportation and distribution activities. In 2022 we improved our calculation methodology to enable emissions from capital goods and transportation and distribution to be reported separately from purchased goods and services. Prior to 2022, emissions from capital goods were included in the data reported for purchased goods and services together with emissions from all transportation and distribution. The table below provides a breakdown of our Scope 3 emissions alongside an overview of the methodology for our Scope 3 calculations. Where the UK Government Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy ('BEIS') emission factors are referenced, these refer to the conversion factors for company reporting of greenhouse gas emissions (published by BEIS in June 2023).

Other information

We use a hybrid approach to calculating Scope 3 category 1 emissions. For the majority of purchased goods and services, we use a spend-based approach whereby our procurement spend on each product category is multiplied by a corresponding environmentally extended input-output ('EEIO') emission factor (drawn from third-party EEIO datasets). For a sub-set of purchased goods, namely mobile phone devices that are purchased from original manufacturers for retail to our customers, we use a product-specific approach, whereby the units of product purchased are multiplied by a corresponding cradle-to-gate product carbon footprint ('PCF'). The PCF data is drawn from EcoRating datasets. For a sub-set of purchased services procured from 20 service-based suppliers, we use a supplier-specific approach whereby our procurement spend on each supplier is multiplied by the supplier's organisational carbon footprint intensity (market-based Scope 1 and 2 plus upstream Scope 3 emissions) in tCO 2 e/mUSD, as disclosed through publicly available 2023 Climate Disclosure Project ('CDP') disclosures. We use a spend-based approach to calculating the emissions for capital goods purchased. Capital expenditure on each type of capital good is multiplied by a corresponding EEIO emission factor (drawn from third-party EEIO datasets).

Changes made to the methodology this year include: - Further improvements to the mapping of EcoRating PCF data (to mobile handset models based on storage capacity and handset type e.g. smart or feature phone) applied to calculate emissions using the product-specific approach; - Increased the number of suppliers where CDP disclosure data has been used; and; - Recategorisation of spend data from Category 1 to Category 8 where the spend item relates to upstream leased assets..

1. Purchased goods and services Emissions from the extraction, production and transportation of goods and services purchased by Vodafone (through operating expenditure).

Changes made to the methodology this year include: - Recategorisation of spend data from Category 2 to Category 8 where the spend relates to upstream leased assets.

2. Capital Goods Emissions from the extraction, production and transportation of capital goods purchased by Vodafone (through capital expenditure).

Other information

Upstream fuel and energy emissions are calculated by applying BEIS emission factors for upstream well-to-tank ('WTT') and transmission and distribution ('T&D') emissions to Vodafone's fuel and energy consumption data. International Energy Agency ('IEA') emissions factors are applied for international electricity consumption.

There were no significant changes to the methodology for this category for this year.

3. Fuel and energy- related activities Emissions from the extraction, production and transportation of fuels and energy purchased by Vodafone and not already included in Scopes 1 and 2. It includes emissions from electricity transmission and distribution. 4. Upstream transportation and distribution Emissions from the transportation and distribution of products purchased by Vodafone between the manufacturing location of our Tier 1 suppliers and our own operations.

We use a hybrid approach to calculating Scope 3 category 4 emissions. For mobile phone devices that are purchased from original manufacturers for retail to our customers, we continued to use our original methodology for calculating these emissions. For these, we estimate the weight of products purchased based on desk-based research and multiply this by the distance between China (representing the origin location for the majority of our products) and the top five countries of purchased goods (representing the market destination of the majority of our products). A modal split of 5% air freight and 95% shipping has been assumed and average BEIS emission factors for freight have been applied to estimate emissions. For all other goods purchased and sold, we estimate associated transportation and distribution emissions using a spend-based approach. These estimates account for transportation and distribution irrespective of whether it is upstream (category 4) or downstream (category 9). Therefore category 9 emissions are accounted for within this category. Where CDP data is used to calculate category 1 emissions we do not disaggregate emissions data relating to transportation and distribution for those purchased services. The emissions from transportation and distribution related to those services are therefore accounted for within our category 1 emissions.

There were no significant changes to the methodology for this category for this year.

Emissions are estimated by applying BEIS emission factors to tonnage of waste generated by our operations across all of our operating companies (not including post-consumer waste from our products). Where actual waste tonnage is not available, this is estimated by extrapolating a per full-time equivalent ('FTE') employee waste tonnage estimate, based on actual tonnage data for our UK operating company. Air travel emissions are calculated based on the distance travelled multiplied by the air travel emission factor for the corresponding ticket-class and flight length. Emission factors are drawn from the BEIS emission factors. The emissions factors applied were drawn from BEIS, for domestic (UK internal), international (non-UK), and long-haul and short-haul (to/from UK) flights. Data for the distance travelled is extracted from the database of Vodafone's third-party travel booking provider. Distance data is included for both outward and return legs of all flights booked with an outward departure date within the reporting period. Rail travel emissions are calculated based on the distance travelled multiplied by a BEIS rail travel emission factor. Other business travel emissions are calculated based on Vodafone's spend (on road, bus and taxi travel) as measured through our travel expenses system, multiplied by corresponding EEIO conversion factors. Emissions are estimated by multiplying the total number of employees (average FTE) per country by the estimated average distance travelled per day, estimated number of working days per year, estimated days working from the office and home per week, estimated proportion travelling by a particular mode of travel and energy use at home, and BEIS emission factors.

There were no significant changes to the methodology for this category for this year.

5. Waste generated in operations Emissions from the disposal and treatment of waste generated by our activities. 6. Business travel Emissions from transportation of employees for business- related flights (air travel) and business-related travel by road and rail.

Changes made to the methodology this year include: - Calculating hotel emissions based on number of nights stayed, previously this was based on spend, multiplied by corresponding EEIO or BEIS conversion factors.

Changes made to the methodology this year include: - Inclusion of working from home emissions based on the hybrid working policies in each of our operating companies.

7. Employee commuting Transportation of

employees between their homes and worksites and energy use from home working during the reporting year.

The most significant upstream leased assets in Vodafone's value chain are radio base station sites leased from third-party tower companies. At the majority of these leased sites, Vodafone owns and operates radio equipment. The electricity consumed by equipment owned and operated by Vodafone falls within our operational control boundary and is therefore accounted for in our Scope 2 emissions. The energy consumption of ancillary equipment (or 'passive' equipment) at these leased sites, which is owned and operated by the third-party landlord, is not within Vodafone's operational control boundary, and therefore contributes to Vodafone's Scope 3 category 8 emissions. These emissions are estimated based on the number of leased radio base station sites multiplied by the estimated average energy consumption of passive equipment, multiplied by the location-based emissions factor corresponding to the location of the site. The estimated average energy consumption of passive equipment is based on energy consumption data (electricity and diesel) of passive equipment at radio base station sites owned and operated by Vodafone. Where transportation of sold products is paid for by Vodafone (through the procurement of services from third-party logistics suppliers), the corresponding emissions are accounted for within Scope 3 category 4. On the basis that downstream transportation and distribution activities (which generally occur within country) are not significant compared to upstream transportation and distribution activities (which generally involve international freight), the emissions for this category have not been disaggregated to account for downstream transportation and distribution separately from upstream transportation and distribution. Therefore, no emissions are reported against this category. Vodafone does not sell products that require further processing before use. Therefore, this category of emissions is not relevant and no emissions are reported against this category.

Changes made to the methodology this year include: - Recategorisation of spend data from Categories 1 and 2 to Category 8 where the spend relates to upstream leased assets.

8. Upstream leased assets Operation of assets leased by Vodafone, including third-party network sites. This includes the relevant sites leased from tower companies. 9. Downstream transportation and distribution Transportation of sold products from the point of sale to the customer. 10. Processing of sold products Downstream processing of sold products (prior to use phase).

There were no changes to the reporting for this category for this year.

These emissions include the emissions from electricity required to use electronic devices that Vodafone sells, including mobile phone handsets, fixed line equipment (such as broadband routers) and other electronic devices. Emissions are calculated based on the number of devices, multiplied by the estimated average lifetime energy use of each device, multiplied by the location-based emissions factor in the country of product sale. The estimated average lifetime energy use of mobile phone handsets is drawn from EcoRating data sets, if available, or else from desk-based research of publicly available information on the energy use of similar devices. For all other devices, use-phase electricity consumption is estimated based on proxies for the average energy use of similar products (based on publicly available information). These emissions do not include the emissions from the use of SIM cards sold by Vodafone, on the basis that SIM cards can be used in a wide range of equipment with a wide range of electricity consumption and do not themselves create emissions. These emissions are calculated based on the estimated weight of products sold by end-of-life disposal channel (based on average rate of waste electronic recycling versus landfill), multiplied by the corresponding BEIS emission factor for each end-of-life channel. The average rate of waste electronic recycling versus landfill is calculated using the average recycling rates in four of our markets (Germany, UK, Italy, Spain), based on desk research of publicly available information.

Changes made to the methodology this year include: - Improved use-phase electricity consumption data based on storage capacity of mobile handsets.

11. Use of sold products

Emissions from the use of goods and services sold by Vodafone, principally from the energy used by network equipment, such as routers, and the energy required to charge mobile devices. 12. End-of-life treatment of sold products Waste disposal and treatment of products sold by the reporting company at the end of their life. 13. Downstream leased assets Emissions from the use of products or equipment leased to third parties.

There were no significant changes to the methodology for this category for this year.

No emissions have previously been reported against this category.

We have reported emissions from downstream leased assets for the first time this year and in all reported periods. This is based on the leased revenue reported in our financial statements. Emissions are calculated using the number of leased assets, multiplied by the lifetime electricity consumption and the corresponding IEA emission factor.

Retail stores where Vodafone has operational control (including ability to specify the equipment installed in the store and how it is operated, irrespective of whether the store is owned or leased by Vodafone) fall within our operational control boundary and are therefore accounted for in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Vodafone operates a franchise model in some of its markets, where retail stores are not under Vodafone's operational control, and where the energy required to operate the store is primarily determined by the decisions of a third-party franchisee. These franchised retail stores fall outside Vodafone's operational boundary and are therefore accounted for in our Scope 3 emissions. These emissions are calculated by multiplying average energy use per retail store (based on the average electricity and natural gas use in retail stores in Germany) by the corresponding IEA and BEIS emission factors for that country, multiplied by number of franchise retail stores in each market. Emissions from joint ventures and associates are calculated based on Vodafone's equity ownership and the corresponding proportion of the company's Scope 1 and 2 emissions. In FY24, these investments included network operators in Australia, the Netherlands, India, Ethiopia, Kenya and infrastructure partners in India. The company's carbon emissions are based on the latest available annual carbon footprint data, either provided directly to Vodafone through engagement with the investee company, or from publicly disclosed company carbon reporting for the latest available reporting year. A proportion of the total annual Scope 1 and 2 emissions of the investee company is reported based on our equity share as at the end of the reporting period. Scope 3 emissions from investee companies are not currently included in this category as we have not yet been able to determine the significance of the Scope 3 emissions to each investee company's total emissions.

There were no significant changes to the methodology for this category for this year.

14. Franchises Operation of franchises in the reporting year, not included in Scope 1 or 2.

There were no significant changes to the methodology for this category for this year.

15. Investments Emissions from activities financed by Vodafone through investments in joint ventures and associates where Vodafone has significant influence.

Carbon enablement Carbon enablement - GHG savings for customers enabled by our green digital solutions Over the last few years Vodafone has been estimating the potential global carbon abatement impact of their products and services with the support of The Carbon Trust, an external consultant. Carbon abatement, also known as enablement or avoided emissions, is an estimated measurement of carbon savings resulting from the use of products and services. It is specifically the measurement of the avoidance or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise have occurred had these connections and services in these use cases not been in place. An estimate of the carbon abatement impact for each use case is calculated by multiplying product volume (e.g., number of IoT connections) by a carbon abatement factor. A use case is a proposition within Vodafone's business customer portfolio that has the potential to reduce carbon emissions (e.g., Smart metering, Fleet management, Health-care monitoring). Vodafone has been working with The Carbon Trust to define and identify these use cases, develop methodologies and estimate the associated carbon abatement impact by applying a carbon factor to each use case. The Carbon Trust is a third-party expert in the field of carbon measurement, and we rely on their expertise to determine the carbon abatement potential of the use case.

The carbon abatement factor for each use case is mainly informed by either an external study, an internal Vodafone study or documented expert assumptions. For use cases where the location of the connection is relevant to the carbon abatement factor, a country-specific input is included (e.g., for Fleet Management, the carbon abatement factor includes average annual emissions for a car in the country where the connection is located). For countries where insufficient data is available, proxies or other assumptions have been substituted. We strive to develop measures of carbon enablement through collaboration with carbon experts and technology sector industry peers. As the science of measuring carbon enablement develops, we recognise ongoing limitations with our current approach, and will continue to evolve our methodology to address them in light of emerging industry standards. These limitations include: - We measure carbon abatement on a gross estimate basis. This means that the carbon emissions avoided are not net of the lifecycle carbon emissions of the product or service itself. - We do not account for any potential rebound effects. This means we do not measure any possible emissions associated with unintended changes of behaviour that could result from the implementation of the products or services. As the methodology for measuring carbon enablement emissions is still developing and industry standards may change, we will continue to evolve our methodology. This may result in a need to amend or update our disclosures and/or our ESG ambitions, goals, commitments and/or targets or our evaluation of progress against these.

We do not claim to be solely attributable for the carbon emissions avoided by the products and services we sell. Rather, we calculate carbon abatement so that we can better understand the potential scale of the carbon emissions that could be avoided, as a measure of how Vodafone contributes to the decarbonisation of society. Our carbon enablement metric has not been externally assured this year. Our carbon enablement target and metrics are currently under review in light of evolving methodologies for measuring the 'net carbon impact' of digital solutions.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.5058823529411764,454249501,100,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

European Union citizens will vote on June 6-9 to choose the 720 members of the next European Parliament, who will serve for five years. Most EU countries hold the election on June 9, but the Netherlands votes on June 6, Ireland and the Czech Republic on June 7 and Malta, Slovakia and Latvia on June 8.

Why it is important:

The European Parliament is one of the three EU institutions that run the 27-nation bloc. Together with EU governments, it decides on laws, proposed by the European Commission, that govern policies and the EU market of almost 450 million people. It does not wield as much power as the Commission or the member states' national governments. But it can reject or substantially amend legislation and, as the only directly elected EU institution, its pronouncements have political clout.

Expected power shift in the European Parliament:

Polls suggest the main pro-EU groups around the political centre - the centre-right, centre-left, Greens and liberals - will have a smaller majority than they currently enjoy, while the far right will make gains.

The polls predict the centrist groups will win around 450 seats in the 720-member chamber. That compares with 491 seats in the outgoing parliament, which has 705 members.

The parties that formed the populist far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) group in the last parliament are projected to gain ground, rising from around 58 seats to 80 or more.

Those parties include the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the National Rally of France's Marine Le Pen and the Lega party of Italy's Matteo Salvini. The group decided on May 23 to expel the AfD over remarks by a party leader about the Nazi SS force.

Another eurosceptic and populist group, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), dominated by Poland's former ruling PiS party and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy, may rise from 68 to around 80 seats.

The projected rise in eurosceptic lawmakers would not stop the EU in its tracks. But it may make it more difficult to push through policies that give the EU more power or share resources within the bloc. This might affect the parliament's stance on policies identified by EU leaders as priorities for the next five years including:

- The EU's transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050

While many of the EU's policies to curb CO2 and methane emissions are already in place in the form of the Green Deal package, some of the laws have reviews coming up in the next five years and pushing through new laws might be tougher.

- Industrial policy to keep the EU competitive against China and the United States

While EU officials argue that a united front gives Europe the best chance of competing with the world's two biggest economies, eurosceptic parties often oppose such an approach, arguing national sovereignty must come first.

- An EU energy union to lower energy prices and make supply more stable

Scarred by the experience of excessive dependence on Russian pipeline gas deliveries, EU countries want to find alternative energy suppliers, expand storage and build out trans-European networks to send electricity across borders. But views differ on how far to go

- A Capital Markets Union to mobilise private money to pay for EU priorities

EU countries have been trying for 10 years to harmonise laws to make it easier to invest in securities across borders and finance companies in this way. But national vested interests have prevented progress. More eurosceptic and nationally-oriented MEPs will not help advance this goal.

- Boosting the EU's defence production capabilities

EU officials argue the bloc needs more joint financing, development and coordination of defence projects, traditionally the domain of national governments. Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows the EU must work together to defend itself, they say. But the issue is highly contentious and would have a tougher time in a more eurosceptic European Parliament.

Influence on top EU jobs

EU leaders take into account the election result when they choose the head of the European Commission, the executive arm that has exclusive power to propose new EU laws.

The centre-right European People's Party is forecast to come first in the election, giving it a strong claim on the post. Its candidate for the Commission presidency is the incumbent, Germany's Ursula von der Leyen.

Influence on EU money

The next European Parliament will co-decide with EU governments on the next EU budget for 2028-2034. The current seven-year budget is around 1.1 trillion euros ($1.18 trillion).

The next long-term budget might be increased and certainly will have to change in terms of spending priorities to take into account the possible enlargement of the EU to include Ukraine, Moldova and the Western Balkans.

Influence on future shape of EU

EU officials and governments say the bloc needs to reform its internal agriculture policy and the way it supports its members to equalise standards of living before it admits new countries, especially big ones such as Ukraine.

Many also say the EU needs to change how it makes decisions, reducing the need for unanimity, if more countries are to join.

Czechia looked through its stockpiles of weapons and delivered everything it could, and the plan of the government and the president of the republic to purchase ammunition for the Ukrainian Armed Forces is known throughout the world as the ""Czech initiative."" Prague actively defends Ukraine's right to be a member of Euro-Atlantic structures on all international platforms. Let's not forget about the huge number of refugees to whom the Czech Republic has granted asylum - almost 4% of the total number of its own population.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic plays a significant role in everything related to assistance to Ukraine. In an interview with Ukrinform, Deputy Foreign Minister Jan Marian spoke about numerous events that focus on support for Ukraine, as well as projects in which the ministry is directly involved. We started with the Peace Summit, participation in which was confirmed by President Petr Pavel.

WIDE PRESENCE AT THE SUMMIT IS A STEP FORWARD TOWARDS LASTING PEACE IN UKRAINE

- In less than a month, on June 15-16, the Global Peace Summit on Ukraine is about to take place in Switzerland. You represented the Czech Republic at one of the ""preparatory"" meetings, in Jeddah. What, in your opinion, should we expect from the summit?

- We expect from this summit a further demonstration and confirmation of the international community's support for the principles of international law that Russia has so bluntly violated when starting the aggression against Ukraine. We believe that most of the international community could unite itself around the international law principles that are embedded in the UN Charter. The wide presence at the summit could then be viewed as a step forward towards a lasting and just peace in Ukraine.

It is equally important and necessary to talk to our global partners, countries like BRICS and other so-called Global South partners and explain to them the core of the Russian aggression and the ways how it undermines international order and stability.

It is also in their interest to find a lasting and just peace solution because Russia's aggression has far-reaching global consequences (food and energy security, nuclear safety and security).

- Czechia, along with France, Japan and Sweden, chairs the working group on nuclear and radiation safety in the framework of President Zelensky's 10-point peace plan. Last month the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Czechia hosted a working meeting on the issue. Who was present and what results were achieved at that meeting?

- We hosted 26 delegations of individual countries and international organizations. More than 70 participants, both experts and diplomats, were present at the WG1 (Radiation and Nuclear Safety) meeting in Prague.

We hosted also a high-level delegation from Ukraine that included Minister of Energy German Galushchenko, Deputy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk, Director of Nuclear and Radiation Safety of Energoatom Oleksandr Depenchuk.

The main outcomes of the workshop focused on the ways how to foster nuclear safety and security of Ukrainian nuclear power plants and on possible international assistance in this area.

For example, there are currently two programs being developed by Ukraine, which focus on restoring the regular operation of the (Russian-occupied) Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP). The participants expressed broad agreement that elaborating a detailed plan of technical steps for ZNPP re-launch would be helpful, covering the process step-by-step, and also allocating expertise, resources and international assistance necessary for its implementation.

CZECHIA SUPPORTS UKRAINE'S FUTURE MEMBERSHIP IN NATO

- On May 30-31, 2024 Prague will host an informal meeting of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) at the level of Ministers of Foreign Affairs. What is Czechia's position on the issue of Ukraine's NATO membership?

- Czechia supports the future membership of Ukraine in NATO as the ultimate security guarantee for Ukraine. At the Vilnius summit, we agreed on a strong package of political and practical support for Ukraine. And we are pleased that NATO reaffirmed that Ukraine will become a member of NATO when conditions are met. We believe that the upcoming NATO summit in Washington will further bolster our support and help Ukraine prepare for NATO membership.

- This year's GLOBSEC Forum will take place in Prague from August 30 to September 1, 2024. You put your signature on the Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in the preparation of it. One of the announced themes of the Forum is support for Ukraine. Who is invited to the event and what aspects of support will be discussed?

- It is true. Support for Ukrainians defending their country against Russia will be the leading topic of the Globsec Forum in Prague. The Russian aggression against Ukraine has had a tremendous impact on global stability and security. We cannot afford Ukraine to lose this war. The consequences would be disastrous for Europe and the world.

President Pavel directly invited President Zelensky to participate in the Forum. The Ukrainian Minister of Defense and other representatives of the Ukrainian government are also invited.

The Globsec Forum is a truly global event, with many Heads of State, Heads of Government, Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Ministers of Defense from a wide range of regions. While the majority represent the EU and NATO countries, we also have the honor of inviting leaders from Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Middle East, and even Asia. Notable attendees include NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

I believe we will succeed with the Globsec think tank to create the right momentum at the Forum and ensure further support for Ukraine that will match the needs in the best possible way.

FOREIGN MINISTER TO LEAD CZECH DELEGATION AT UKRAINE RECOVERY CONFERENCE

- Who will represent Czechia at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Berlin in June?

- The delegation to the URC in Berlin will be led by Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský.

Preparations for the conference and communication with the organizers are currently underway. At the same time, Czechia is interested in having as many representatives of its private and non-profit sectors as possible.

- The Czech ammunition initiative has gained wide recognition. What role does the MFA play in it, if any?

- As Ukraine is fighting bravely, it needs immediate and effective military aid. Therefore, Czechia and other Allies continue to deliver weapons, ammunition and equipment to Ukraine and help train Ukrainian forces.

The Czech initiative helps procure ammunition from third countries in a situation when European, including Ukrainian, defense industry capacities are still expanding.

CZECH PATRONAGE OF DNIPROPETROVSK REGION - AREA OF SPECIAL INTEREST

- There were reports that Prague agreed with Kyiv last year to open its diplomatic office in the city of Dnipro, which Czechia wants to take under the patronage for the post-war reconstruction. Is there any development in this regard?

- Czechia has an intensive program of cooperation with the Dnipropetrovsk region. To open a diplomatic mission in Dnipro is a logical step in the direction of deepening it. We are already making steps in this direction.

At the moment, a special diplomatic post at the embassy in Kyiv has been created - a special diplomat for Dnipro. This position has been filled since the summer of last year. The next step will be to establish an Embassy office in Dnipro. These steps will lead to the establishment of a full-fledged Consulate General in the future, as soon as the situation allows.

While it is not possible to consider the full reconstruction of the country until the conflict is over, it is undeniably possible to express a specific interest in the reconstruction through the selection of a specific area. The conceptual approach can be better coordinated this way.

The selection of the Dnipropetrovsk region as a Czech priority for reconstruction has significantly strengthened the position of Czechia and Czech companies in the region. However, the choice of one region does not mean that Czech companies and public institutions cannot be involved in projects in the rest of the country, just as Czechia's humanitarian and development assistance is also focused on other Ukrainian regions.

The Czech patronage of the Dnipropetrovsk region could thus be described as an area of special interest rather than an area of exclusive Czech attention. This area of special interest should be concretely reflected in the implementation of bilateral projects.

Furthermore, special consideration of the Dnipropetrovsk region should be given when implementing projects under the Humanitarian, Reconstruction, Stabilization and Economic Assistance Program to Ukraine 2023 - 2025 (Program Ukraine).

All ministries in charge of implementing individual chapters of the program should first take into account the suitability and feasibility of implementing such projects in the Dnipropetrovsk region when evaluating project proposals.

In the case of projects already implemented elsewhere, consideration should be given to their extension to the Dnipropetrovsk region (e.g. Czech MEDEVAC projects in Western Ukraine).

CZECHIA WANTS COORDINATED APPROACH WITH EU ON UKRAINIAN MILITARY-AGE MEN ABROAD

- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Czechia is known for its very concrete support for Ukraine. For example, at the end of last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs undertook to provide a monetary contribution of 3 million crowns intended to ensure the transport of 25 trams to Ukrainian Konotop. What other initiatives could be mentioned?

- Czechia supports the agreed framework for EU security commitments to Ukraine. Czech Government has prepared a special Humanitarian, stabilization, reconstruction and economic assistance program for Ukraine 2023-2025 that includes a wider region (especially Moldova and Georgia). We provide humanitarian assistance to Ukraine through in-kind inputs and material support to enable people to access healthcare, water management and sanitation, care for war veterans and socially vulnerable groups of population, drinking water, electricity and heating or shelters for internally displaced people in Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in neighboring countries.

In addition to the delivery of 25 trams to Ukraine that you mentioned, among the most significant cases (ongoing or being prepared) are, for example, the contribution to humanitarian demining of agricultural areas affected by the war and the contribution to World Food Program - transport of Ukrainian grain to specific African countries. This list also includes the contribution to technical equipment of the training center and dormitory in the city of Dnipro - Center of Vocational and Technical Education Dnipro; equipment of the Kharkiv Perinatal Center, operating theaters of the Volyn Regional Hospital; equipment of the surgeries of general medicine, gynaecology and surgery - Marhanets Hospital, maternity hospital equipment in the city of Lviv; and deliveries of mobile water treatment plants to Ukrainian regions affected by water shortage.

- There is a big discussion going on in Ukraine and in the European countries with the large number of Ukrainian refugees concerning men aged 18 to 60. Ukraine would like to have them back. Does your ministry participate in the debate?

- Yes, MFA and its counterparts, mainly Ministry of Interior, is participating in the ongoing debate on the situation of the Ukrainian citizens in Czechia who fall under the conditions of the new law on mobilization. We aim to reach a coordinated approach with other EU/Schengen countries in this regard.",ukrinform.net,news,Ukrinform-EN,,0.2627450980392156,454229631,11,https://static.ukrinform.com/photos/2024_05/thumb_files/630_360_1716456633-803.jpg,

A new report from IBM X-Force exposes changes in the Grandoreiro malware landscape. The banking trojan is now capable of targeting more than 1,500 global banks in more than 60 countries, and it has been updated with new features.

Also, Grandoreiro's targeting has become wider, as it initially only targeted Spanish-speaking countries, while recent attack campaigns targeted countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. In addition, the malware is now sending phishing emails directly from the victim's Microsoft Outlook local client to recipients' email addresses found in the local system.

According to Interpol, the Grandoreiro banking trojan has been a major threat across Spanish-speaking countries since 2017. The malware's main functionalities allow cybercriminals to control devices on the infected computer, enable keylogging, handle windows and processes, open a browser and execute JavaScript inside it, upload or download files, and send emails, in addition to its banking trojan capabilities.

Analysis of different attack campaigns reveals that many operators are involved in Grandoreiro attacks, as stated by cybersecurity company Kaspersky, which wrote in July 2020, ""It is still not possible to link this malware to any specific cybercrime group, although it is clear that the campaign is using a MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service) business model.""

SEE: Kaspersky Study: Devices Infected With Data-Stealing Malware Increased by 7 Times Since 2020

Arrests of suspected cybercriminals in relation to Grandoreiro happened in 2021, with 16 suspects being caught by the Spanish Police on charges of laundering funds stolen through two banking trojans, including Grandoreiro. More recently, Brazilian authorities arrested five programmers and administrators behind the banking malware, who were suspected to have defrauded victims of more than €3.5 million.

Yet the malware, developed in Brazil, is still active and has started expanding its target list to other countries, such as Japan, Netherlands, Italy and South Africa, as reported in the new research from IBM's X-Force team.

Since March 2024, several Grandoreiro phishing campaigns have impersonated entities in Mexico, such as Mexico's Tax Administration Service, Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission or the Revenue Service of Argentina.

Different social engineering techniques have been used since March 2024 in the emails to entice the user to click a link: a final notice to pay a debt, a reminder that one can access their account statement in PDF or XML format or a reminder to read details on a compliance notice.

In those phishing campaigns, only users originating from specific countries -- Mexico, Chile, Spain, Costa Rica, Peru, Argentina -- are being redirected to a payload when clicking on the link provided in the email.

Following the recent arrests involving Grandoreiro operators, researchers observed a surge in campaigns targeting countries beyond the usual Spanish-speaking ones, including Japan, the Netherlands, Italy and South Africa, with emails written in English.

After the user clicks the malicious link in the phishing email, a custom loader is launched, presenting a fake Adobe PDF Reader captcha, which requires a click to continue with the execution, probably to distinguish between real users and automated systems such as sandboxes.

Then, the loader collects some victim data and sends it to the command&control server using encryption based on AES and base64 algorithms. The data sent to the C2 consists of the computer and user names, the operating system version, the antivirus name, the victim's public IP address, and a list of running processes. In addition, the loader checks for the existence of the Microsoft Outlook client as well as crypto wallets and special banking security products such as IBM Trusteer or Topaz OFD.

The loader can be configured to disallow victims from specific countries based on their IP addresses. One malware sample found by IBM X-Force stopped if the user was located in Russia, Czech Republic, Poland or Netherlands.

If all conditions are met, the Grandoreiro banking trojan is downloaded, decrypted via an RC4-based algorithm and executed.

Grandoreiro's list of targeted applications has increased to more than 1,500 banks worldwide, according to IBM X-Force, with bank applications also tied to regions. For example, if the victim's country is identified as Belgium, the malware will search for all targeted banking applications associated with the European region.

In addition, 266 unique strings are used by the malware to identify cryptocurrency wallets.

Researchers Golo Mühr and Melissa Frydrych analyzed the malware in depth and found the malware, which traditionally relied on domain generation algorithms to find its C2 server references, contained a reworked DGA.

The new algorithm introduces multiple seeds for its DGA, ""used to calculate a different domain for each mode or functionality of the banking trojan, allowing separation of C2 tasks among several operators as part of their Malware-as-a-Service operation"" as stated by the researchers.

For one analyzed sample, for a given day, 12 domains could be used as C2 domains, with four of them being active on that day and leading to Brazilian-based IP addresses.

Recent versions of Grandoreiro abuse the local Microsoft Outlook software when available on an infected computer.

The malware interacts with the Outlook Security Manager Tool, a tool designed to develop Outlook add-ins. The use of the tool allows the malware to disable alerts within Outlook before it starts harvesting all sender email addresses found in the victim's mailbox, filtering the email addresses to avoid collecting unwanted ones such as those containing ""noreply,"" ""feedback"" or ""newsletter,"" to name a few from the malware's blocklist.

In addition, the malware scans parts of the victim's folders recursively to hunt for more email addresses, looking for files with specific extensions, including .csv, .txt, .xls and .doc.

The malware then starts sending spam based on phishing templates it received from its C2 server before deleting all the sent emails from the victim's mailbox.

In order to avoid being caught by the user who could notice suspicious behavior from the computer, the malware only starts sending the emails when the last input on the machine is at least five minutes old or longer in some malware variants.",techrepublic.com,news,TechRepublic,Cedric Pernet,-0.2156862745098039,454185455,1,https://assets.techrepublic.com/uploads/2024/05/tr_20240523-ibm-xforce-grandoreiro-banking-trojan-malware.jpg,eng-9585720

The organisation said that despite Swiss progress on solar power last year, it was not enough to close the gap with other countries.

In 2023, Switzerland thus ranks 22nd in a European comparison, just ahead of Malta, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia and Latvia, SES said in a statement on Thursday.

Every year, the organisation analyses the per capita production of solar and wind-generated electricity in Switzerland and the 27 European Union (EU) member states.

Top-ranked countries Denmark and Sweden produce six to seven times more solar and wind-generated electricity per capita than Switzerland. And when compared with the eight countries around it, Switzerland finds itself in the penultimate spot.

Just 9% of the electricity consumed in Switzerland is generated by solar panels and wind turbines in Switzerland. In Denmark, the figure is over 70%.

In wind power, the Netherlands is now in the European lead, producing more than twice as much solar energy per capita as Switzerland. Germany is also ahead of Switzerland in terms of solar electricity production.

On June 9, the Swiss electorate will vote on the so-called electricity law, which proposes binding targets and an investment-friendly framework to drive the development of renewable energies. The SES is campaigning in favour of a yes vote.

summer should also provide significant positive momentum here. Falling gas and electricity prices will boost consumer spending, while only a slow decline is forecast for key inflation.

Turnaround in the construction industry

As a late-cycle industry, the construction sector has recently had to contend with the weak economic con- ditions. However, a stabilisation seems to be emerging since the start of 2024. In February, there were renewed growth trends in European construction volumes, which were supported by both civil engineering and building construction in equal measure.

In building construction, residential construction remained burdened by the high interest rate environ- ment. Although the demand for affordable housing remains high, property developers are hesitant to award contracts due to a lack of financing. PORR continues to see stable demand in industrial construction, driven not least by megatrends such as digitalisation and the technology sector. In public building construction, the healthcare sector in particular is ensuring a stable order intake alongside social housing.

Growth in civil engineering and infrastructure construction is continuing, whereby it remains a significant pillar for the construction industry as a whole. In the first two months of 2024, the volumes in European civil engineering volume recorded an average growth rate of 2.6%. The main driver of this growth is the energy transition underway across Europe, which is ensuring continuous demand in pipeline and power plant construction. The demand for sustainable mobility is equally strong, which is particularly evident in new and expansion projects in railway construction.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.5372549019607844,454136337,4,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

Labour and the Conservatives will go head-to-head on a range of divisive issues over the next six weeks as the general election campaign gets underway.

A rain-sodden Rishi Sunak announced the date of the vote as July 4 in a surprise address from Downing Street this afternoon.

'Now is the moment for Britain to decide its future,' the Prime Minister told voters.

The state of the economy, immigration - including migrant deportation flights to Rwanda - and the NHS are all set to be key issues during the election campaign.

But there will also be fights over other topics such as defence spending, the environment, and Britain's attitude to the war in Gaza.

It is expected to be a dirty fight with Mr Sunak having already made clear he will paint Labour's Sir Keir Starmer as a danger to the economy and national security.

The economy

Taxes, economic growth and the cost-of-living crisis are expected to be at the front and centre of the general election battle between the two main parties.

The country has been through a massive period of turmoil since Boris Johnson won the last general election in December 2019: Brexit, Covid and then the shocks of the short-lived Liz Truss premiership.

But Mr Sunak's decision to go to the polls in July is based largely on the idea that the economy has bounced back and that voters can now trust the Conservatives more than they can Labour.

Rumours of an impending general election announcement gathered pace after Mr Sunak hailed a 'major milestone' with inflation tumbling to the lowest level in nearly three years.

In latest figures announced this morning, the headline CPI rate slid from 3.2 per cent in March to 2.3 per cent last month - near the Bank of England's 2 per cent target.

The PM said the figures showed that his plan is working and 'brighter days are ahead' - a slogan the likes of which we can expect to hear a lot in the coming weeks.

The UK has had the lowest annual inflation rate for electricity, gas and other fuels on record

The Tories will try to paint Labour as still akin to the party it was when Jeremy Corbyn was leader, a danger to people's livelihoods and homes.

This however will be a tricky ask, given what has happened in the past two years.

Mortgage rates are still high by recent standards and despite the fall in inflation it is not expected they will fall before the election happens.

And Labour under Sir Keir has been at pains to distance itself from the Corbyn years. Mr Corbyn has been kicked out of the party and his allies sidelines as it seeks to win over businesses as well as voters.

Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves this morning said she was 'much more ambitious for the country than Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt seem to be'.

Speaking to reporters, the shadow chancellor said Labour would focus on 'bringing stability back to our economy' including through 'our plan to invest in home-grown renewables so we're less reliant on Putin and dictators around the world for our basic energy needs and can bring energy bills down for families and pensioners'.

Additionally taxes are currently at a 70-year high, and polls suggest voters now associate the Tories as much with high rates as Labour.

'After 14 years of Conservative chaos families are worse off. Prices in the shops have soared, mortgage bills have risen and taxes are at a 70-year high,' Ms Reeves said.

'Rishi Sunak is now putting family finances at risk again with his £46 billion unfunded policy to abolish national insurance that will mean higher borrowing, higher taxes or the end of the state pension as we know it.

'It's time for change. Labour's first steps will deliver economic stability so we can grow our economy and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible.'

Immigration

Mr Sunak will be hoping he can get the first Rwanda migrant deportation flight off the ground before the general election.

The first aircraft is due to head to east Africa at the start of July, in a move that Mr Sunak hopes will end Channel small boat crossings and improve Tory election chances.

But the PM still faces the thorny issue of legal migration, which Mr Sunak himself has acknowledged is 'too high'.

The latest net migration estimates could become the first focus of debate among voters when they are published tomorrow.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) will publish the figures on Thursday, at the same time as the Home Office releases its quarterly immigration statistics containing a host of detail on visas, the asylum system and Channel crossings.

The Government has brought in a raft of restrictions since the start of the year amid pressure to cut the record number of people legally arriving in Britain.

Earlier on Wednesday, before the election was announced, Home Secretary James Cleverly declared the Conservatives' plan to cut legal migration levels was working, as his department's figures indicated a fall in the number of overseas student and foreign care worker visa applications.

This was despite the data also signalling a jump in the number of work visa applications.

Thursday's ONS net migration figures, to December 2023, will provide a comparison with the previous 12 months and cover a period preceding the introduction of the Government's reforms so they are unlikely to show a significant reduction.

The Home Office stressed the ONS figures 'do not take into account the major package measures announced in December which have already started to have an effect'.

Fresh migration statistics to be published on Thursday are expected to show the number of people coming to Britain remains high

The NHS

The NHS consistently ranks as the second most important issue for voters and, again, it is a policy area in which the Conservatives have work to do to improve public perceptions of their performance.

Historically high waiting lists for treatment, ageing infrastructure across the NHS estate and workforce challenges combine to paint a picture of the much-loved health service on its knees.

The Government has made progress in reducing waiting times since the Covid pandemic, but the scale of the problem means the figures remain at a level many voters will be disturbed by.

Meanwhile, Labour has promised to cut waiting times and increase appointments and operations.

However, the scale of the issues in the NHS, the complexities across the system and wider related services, as well as the scale of funding involved, pose a huge challenge for whichever party wins power.

Workers' rights

The Tories have warned Labour are planning to bring in 'new French-style laws' as Sir Keir's party plots an overhaul of workers' rights if they win power.

Labour chiefs and trade union bosses last week reached agreement over the party's proposed 'New Deal for Working People' after spending hours locked in showdown discussions.

The meeting came after weeks of tensions between Sir Keir and those unions who bankroll Labour over claims the planned employment reforms were being weakened.

There had been fears among unions that Labour was bowing to pressure from businesses to water down the plans ahead of the general election.

Business chiefs have swiped at the proposals - spearheaded by deputy leader Angela Rayner - by warning against excessive regulation that might harm productivity.

Under Ms Rayner's plans to strengthen workers' rights, a Labour government would ban zero-hour contracts and end 'fire and rehire' practices.

There are also proposals to entitle employees to sick pay and parental leave from day one, introduce a 'right to switch off' after leaving the office, and boost workers' rights to flexible working.

And Labour wants to empower adult social care professionals and trade unions that represent them to negotiate a sector-wide agreement for pay, terms and conditions.

Tory ministers have swiped that Sir Keir has 'surrendered' to Ms Rayner and trade unions by backing the plans.

Business minister Kevin Hollinrake said earlier this month: 'Their new French-style laws will ban flexible working, make it harder for small businesses to hire new staff and make it much easier to strike.

'That's why businesses are warning this risks costing jobs and damaging the economy.'

Gaza

The Middle East conflict has prompted serious divisions within Labour, which the Tories could seek to exploit during the general election campaign.

Sir Keir has come under intense pressure from Labour activists, local councillors and a large number of his MPs to shift his stance ever since the Hamas terror attacks on 7 October.

The Labour leader has repeatedly defended Israel's right to self defence in the wake of those attacks as he kept his party close to the Government's position on the crisis.

But a dividing line has recently opened up between the two parties after Labour appeared to back the International Criminal Court's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.

The ICC's chief prosecutor Karim Khan triggered international outrage after saying he would apply for arrest warrants for key Israeli and Hamas figures who he said were responsible for war crimes in Gaza and Israel.

They include Mr Netanyahu, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant as well as Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh.

He accused Israel of using 'starvation as a method of warfare' and carrying out 'collective punishment' of the population of Gaza and said Hamas's actions were 'unconscionable crimes' that 'demand accountability'.

But Labour shadow foreign secretary David Lammy defended the court and said that 'international law must be upheld'.

Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protesters are pictured confronting each other in central London, exchanging boos and opposing chants

This prompted David Cameron to brand Labour the 'odd man out' as he noted how Germany, the US, Italy, Austria and the Czech Republic had all fiercely condemned the action by the ICC's chief prosecutor.

The Foreign Secretary compared this to how Labour 'seems to be saying it supports the ICC in every way' as he labelled the decision by The Hague-based court 'a mistake'.

He also hit out at the ICC for drawing 'moral equivalence' between Mr Netanyahu and Hamas terrorists, in an echo of Mr Sunak's own criticism of the 'deeply unhelpful' move.

But Labour sources denied that Mr Lammy had drawn any moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas.

They said he was in agreement with other countries including France, Germany and the EU in backing the independence of the ICC.

Lord Cameron said the seeking of arrest warrants was not going to help 'get the hostages out, it's not going to help get aid in and it's not going to help deliver a sustainable ceasefire'.

'As we have said from the outset, because Israel is not a signatory to the Rome Statute and because Palestine is not yet recognised as a state we don't think that the court has jurisdiction in this area,' he added.",dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,,-0.0980392156862745,454103119,1,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/22/19/85216889-0-image-m-26_1716404042354.jpg,eng-9589547

The PTC must now decide, based on the evidence Khan submitted, whether there are ""reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court"" (Rome Statute, art. 58(1)(a)).

If so, the Court will issue warrants against Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar (Hamas's head in Gaza), Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (leader of Hamas's military wing, the al-Qassam Brigade), and Ismael Haniyeh (head of Hamas's political bureau, who resides in Qatar). The Prosecutor accuses them of eight different war crimes and crimes against humanity: murder, extermination, hostage taking, sexual violence, torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and ""other inhumane acts"" - the last six of these ""in the context of captivity"" of the hostages.

Prosecutor Khan has also requested arrest warrants against Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, accused of seven war crimes and crimes against humanity. These are starvation of civilians as a weapon of war, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, willful killing or murder, intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population (all these are war crimes) plus extermination and/or murder, persecution, and ""other inhumane acts"" as crimes against humanity.

Nobody claims that these leaders have personally killed or tortured anyone. That doesn't matter, because anyone who ""orders, solicits, or induces"" others to commit Rome Statute crimes can be charged as a principal (art. 25(3)(b)).

What follows are some preliminary thoughts and questions - explaining some of the charges, but also asking why certain charges were not in Prosecutor Khan's request.

What I will not comment on is whether any of the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant are justified, for one simple reason: I have no idea what evidence the prosecutor has to support the accusations. Khan's public announcement asserts that his team set a threshold even stronger than reasonable belief: ""a realistic prospect of conviction."" But, lacking insider knowledge of the evidence or the facts on the ground, it would be completely irresponsible to opine on the strength of his cases - not that this is likely to stop anyone from sounding off about it. U.S. President Joe Biden and leaders in the UK, Austria, and the Czech Republic have denounced the Prosecutor's move as outrageous ""false equivalency."" That response misses the mark. An accusation that both sides have committed war crimes does not say the two sides are morally equivalent. It does not say they are politically equivalent. It does not even say they are legally equivalent. All it means, as Khan said in an interview Monday, is that ""no people anywhere are saints.""

One way they are not equivalent is that Israel can stop the ICC investigation in its tracks by launching its own investigation. Under the ICC's founding principle of complementarity, a case is ""inadmissible"" if it is being ""investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution"" (Rome Statute art. 17(1)(a)). Israel has one of the world's most sophisticated justice systems. It is clearly able to investigate the charges. Palestine, on the other hand - meaning the Palestinian Authority - is in no position to investigate and prosecute war crimes by Hamas committed in Israel and Gaza, even if it wanted to.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accused the Prosecutor of ignoring complementarity by not ""allowing the Israeli legal system a full and timely opportunity to proceed. ... The prosecutor did not afford the same opportunity to Israel, which has ongoing investigations into allegations against its personnel."" This too misses the mark. It may be that Israel is investigating war crimes allegations against individual IDF fighters on the ground - but it shows no intention of investigating Netanyahu and Gallant, and these are the men the prosecutor has accused. It is not too late for Israel to exercise complementarity by investigating the accusations against its leaders.

With those cautions in mind, what do we make of the charges themselves?

The most noteworthy, and potentially confusing, counts in the request are the accusations against both sides' leaders of ""extermination"" as a crime against humanity - and the conspicuous absence of the charge of genocide.

For those unfamiliar with international criminal law, extermination and genocide may seem like two names for the same crime. Obviously, campus demonstrators and others over the past months have hurled the accusation of genocide against Israel, infuriating many Israelis and their supporters. So did an unusually intemperate report by U.N. Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, whose ""Anatomy of a Genocide"" draft report speculatively dismissed all of Israel's military justifications for the Gaza war as mere ""humanitarian camouflage"" for genocide, adding that in her opinion genocide is ""inherent to settler-colonialism"" (and, obviously, assuming without argument that Israel is a settler-colonialist state). South Africa has accused Israel of genocide, in litigation before the International Court of Justice, and it may seem as though Prosecutor Khan is now confirming that accusation by accusing Netanyahu and Gallant of extermination. That is untrue, because the two crimes are quite different.To be clear: with or without genocide, the other accusations against the Israeli leaders are exceptionally grave.

The Hamas defendants are also charged with extermination, but not with genocide. As I explain below, there is actually a strong case for calling the October 7th attack genocide against a part of the Israeli people. To see why, we need to examine the difference between the crimes.

That difference lies in the different definitions of ""crime against humanity,"" ""extermination,"" and ""genocide."" Crimes against humanity (CAH for short) are crimes committed as part of an organized attack on a civilian population; the Rome Statute names 11 CAHs, one of which is extermination. To count as ""extermination,"" a perpetrator must have killed at least one person ""as part of a mass killing"" (ICC Elements of Crimes, Article 7(1)(b)(2)). ""Genocide"" requires something even more sinister: an intention to destroy a national, racial, ethnic, or religious group as such ""in whole or in part."" A key difference is the presence or absence of genocidal intention - the intention to destroy the group.

Israel's rebuttal of genocide accusations has always been that it is acting in self-defense against a deadly threat in a war that it did not start and did not want; and that it aims to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people in Gaza. In fact, the Prosecutor explicitly agrees that Israel ""has a right to take action to defend its population."" (The ICJ, in its 2004 advisory opinion Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, ¶141, called it a duty.) Israel argues that the civilian casualties are unintended collateral damage (""incidental"" in the antiseptic language of international humanitarian law), inevitable because Hamas has so deeply embedded itself in the vicinity of civilians - which is itself a war crime. Israel has denied that the IDF targets civilians, and it insists that it complies with the laws of war.

Obviously, the Prosecutor disagrees that Israel has complied with the law. One notable feature of the legal definition of ""extermination"" is that it uses the term ""killed"" rather than ""murdered"" - and the Elements further explains that ""killed"" means simply ""caused death."" Thus, mass killings don't mean anything like premeditated murders, although the Prosecutor's arrest warrant request charges ""extermination and/or murder,"" indicating that he is not ruling out that some Israeli killings are murder. The expert panel advising the prosecutor explains why here, ¶¶29-31. The panelists clarify that the charge refers to ""the killing of civilians who died as a result of starvation,"" adding that ""a large number of Palestinian civilians have already died in these circumstances."" Ominously, ""The Panel's assessment is that there are reasonable grounds to believe that ... the suspects meant these deaths to happen or ... they were aware that deaths would occur in the ordinary course of events as a result of their methods of warfare.""

Crucially, the Statute explains that ""extermination"" can include ""the intentional infliction of conditions of life, inter alia the deprivation of access to food and medicine, calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population"" - and that seems to be the heart of the accusation against Israel. It runs parallel to another accusation in the Prosecutor's statement: that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war, which is a war crime.

Extermination and deliberate starvation are horrifying charges. They can be plausibly alleged only because of the staggering number of civilian casualties, the famine unfolding in Gaza, and Israel's foot-dragging (or obstruction) regarding humanitarian aid. Khan points especially to the siege of Gaza that began on Oct.8, cutting off access to food, water, medicine, and electricity. ""This took place alongside other attacks on civilians, including those queuing for food; obstruction of aid delivery by humanitarian agencies; and attacks on and killing of aid workers, which forced many agencies to cease or limit their operations in Gaza."" As early as Oct. 11, Tom Dannenbaum persuasively made the case that this obstruction looked like the war crime of starvation used as a method of warfare.

But the Prosecutor did not charge genocide, which signals that he does not have sufficient evidence of the intent to destroy the Gazans in whole or in part. And while he left the door open to potential future charges, the omission of genocide at this stage means something, because his team has been looking for evidence for months. His accusations are based on ""interviews with survivors and eyewitnesses, authenticated video, photo and audio material, satellite imagery and statements from the alleged perpetrator group"" - presumably, better evidence than we have seen in the noisy public debates and ICJ filings.

Implicitly, then - and whether he meant to or not - Prosecutor Khan has buttressed Israel's repeated insistence in the ICJ litigation that there is no plausible genocide case against Israel - in which case, as the Israeli Judge Aharon Barak argued (here, ¶¶6, 19), the ICJ has no jurisdiction over the Gaza war because South Africa's case was brought solely under the Convention Against Genocide.

Is there really insufficient evidence of genocidal intent? Both South Africa and the Special Rapporteur documented numerous statements by high-ranking Israeli public figures (including cabinet ministers) that can plausibly be interpreted as calls to genocide. (See South Africa's initial ICJ application, ¶¶101-107, and the Special Rapporteur's ""Anatomy of a Genocide"" report, ¶¶50-54.) Israel's response is that none of this populist rhetoric comes from anyone in the chain of command (see Sir Malcolm Shaw's oral argument to the ICJ, pages 31-35, §§ 36-52). The absence of a genocide charge in today's arrest warrant request strongly suggests that Prosecutor Khan agrees that flamethrowing populist rhetoric by figures outside the chain of command is not evidence of genocidal intent within the chain of command.

Those statements may not inculpate Netanyahu, Gallant, and IDF leaders - but they could support charges against right-wing political leaders for incitement to genocide. Even if these men and women aren't in the chain of command, and even if they are only haranguing their political base, we must not forget that the IDF is a citizens' army that draws from all sectors of Israeli society including their political base. If any IDF soldiers killed Gazan civilians with genocidal intent, then the leaders who incited them could be guilty of incitement to genocide (Rome Statute, art. 25(3)(e)) - which also happens to be a capital offense under Israel's own domestic law (here, §§ 2, 3(a)(2)).

Even without the genocide charge, the other accusations against Netanyahu and Gallant are terrible enough. Indeed, Prosecutor Khan comes perilously close to a genocide accusation when he writes that along with eliminating Hamas and returning the hostages, the leaders' third war aim is to ""collectively punish the civilian population of Gaza, whom they perceived as a threat to Israel."" Furthermore, his arrest warrant request accuses them of persecution as a CAH, defined in the Rome Statute as ""the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity."" In other words, he charges group-based animus and serious deprivation of fundamental rights. What is lacking for the charge of genocide is the intent to destroy, rather than ""merely"" to persecute.

What about Hamas? Could its leaders be accused of genocide? The answer is yes, and the case is clearer than the case against Israel, even though the number of deaths Hamas inflicted is far fewer. To those who think that genocide always involves mass killings, this will seem absurd - but there is no numbers requirement for crimes to qualify as genocide as a matter of law. Genocide includes the destruction of the group ""in part,"" which courts have rightly interpreted as a substantial part. But long ago the ICTY established that ""substantial"" has to do with the part's significance or prominence, not numbers alone (Prosecutor v. Krstić, Appeals Chamber Judgment ¶¶12-16).

The October 7th ""Al Aqsa Flood"" attack included multiple actus rei of genocide, most obviously the murder of over a thousand people and the infliction of serious bodily or mental harm on hundreds more, including the hostages. The significance and prominence of this group of victims could hardly be more obvious, and they probably qualify as a substantial part of the Israeli nation as a whole on the ICTY's Krstić test. The individual crimes ""took place in the context of a manifest context of similar conduct"" - a requirement in the Elements for the crime of genocide.

And there seems to be little doubt that they were carried out with the intent to destroy the national group of Israeli Jews in whole or in part. It doesn't matter that the accused leaders knew the attack could not succeed in that aim: what makes their crimes genocide is the intent to destroy the national group as such, an intent the Hamas leadership has seldom disguised. (Some leaders' statements were quoted by Israel's advocate Tal Becker in an ICJ hearing, pp. 15-16, §§ 22-24. Among these is a chilling statement by Hamas official Ghazi Hamad: ""We will repeat the October 7 attack time and again, until Israel is annihilated."")

It does not matter that the 2017 revision of Hamas's charter removed the overt antisemitism of its 1988 original. It now explains that Hamas's struggle is not against Jews because of their Jewishness (i.e., their membership in a religious or ethnic group), but against the ""Zionists who occupy Palestine"" (here, §16). The phrase can be interpreted in more than one way, but the most natural is that it refers to Israeli Jews, understood as a national group. That matters because national groups, no less than religious, racial, and ethnic groups, are protected by the Genocide Convention and the Rome Statute.

Why, then, did the prosecutor not charge genocide against the Hamas leaders? Here I can only speculate that given the enormous disparity in the number of casualties, it would have seemed bizarre and one-sided to charge Hamas with genocide without levying that charge against Israel as well.

So far, I have focused on genocide and extermination, and considered the significance of Prosecutor Khan's decision not to charge genocide. Other omissions are also significant, but hard to interpret. I will mention two.

The first is Hamas's deep embedding in and beneath civilian structures - human shielding that surely accounts for a great deal of the devastation caused by Israel's campaign to destroy Hamas. Under the Rome Statute, human shielding is a war crime: ""Utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas or military forces immune from military operations"" (Rome Statute, art. 8(2)(b)(xxiii)). Now it might be objected that Hamas's aim was never to make its forces immune from attack, but rather to provoke it - to delegitimize Israel by making sure that when the IDF responded to October 7th (as it inevitably would) the result would be horrifying and highly visible damage to Gazan civilians. Of course that is speculation by Hamas's enemies, and legally Hamas's expectations of what the IDF would do are irrelevant. The Elements explains that the crime is committed if the perpetrator ""took advantage of the location of one or more civilians"" intending ""to shield a military objective from attack or shield, favour or impede military operations."" At the very least, it seems clear that Hamas intended that placing military assets in civilian structures would impede Israeli military operations.

The most likely explanation of this omission is a peculiarity of this case: that the Gaza War is, in the Prosecutor's words, ""an international armed conflict between Israel and Palestine, and a non-international armed conflict between Israel and Hamas running in parallel."" In the Rome Statute, human shielding is a war crime only in international armed conflicts (IACs) - a truly unfortunate omission. As the authors of the ICRC's massive 2005 study Customary International Humanitarian Law noted about in bello rules, ""Common sense would suggest that such rules, and the limits they impose on the way war is waged, should be equally applicable in international and non-international armed conflicts"" (vol. 1, page xxix). Cabining off one of Hamas's most serious offenses against its own civilians seems artificial and legally unnecessary. If the Gaza War is indeed part of an international armed conflict with Palestine, it was surely open to the Prosecutor to apply the IAC rules to this egregious violation.

Second, and more minor (but puzzling nonetheless): Prosecutor Khan charged Israeli leaders with the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population - but did not charge the same crime against Hamas leaders. He could have, because intentional attacks on a civilian population are Rome Statute crimes in both international and non-international armed conflicts.

Two more observations, unrelated to the above:

First, the current set of accusations concerns only Gaza, not the West Bank. But the West Bank is also part of the ""Situation in Palestine"" that the Prosecutor has been investigating for several years. So we may see indictments involving the West Bank in the not-too-distant future.

Second, of historical note: as I mentioned above, Prosecutor Khan consulted with a panel of experts, whose report issued concurrently with his announcement Monday; it supports his request for arrest warrants. Among the experts is Theodor Meron, a distinguished jurist, former President of the ICTY, and - notably - a former legal adviser to Israel's Foreign Ministry at the time of the Six Days' War. At that time, he wrote a secret memorandum warning that the establishment of settlements in the newly occupied territory would violate Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. His memo came to light many years later, as Meron himself finally confirmed in a 2017 law review article (The West Bank and International Humanitarian Law on the Eve of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Six-Day War). All these decades later, Meron still believes that applying the law faithfully is in Israel's interest.",justsecurity.org,news,Just Security,,-0.4823529411764705,454094859,1,https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-597691694-e1606708064553.jpg,eng-9584015

Additionally, it has previously identified data centres as one of the most attractive sectors for the ongoing diversification of its business portfolio and securing this rare opportunity in Frankfurt - home to one of the world's busiest Internet Exchange Points, DE-CIX - is its first major move into the sector.

The proposed data centre campus comprises an initial 32MW of IT-load, with an eventual full build-out capacity of up to 70MW of IT-load in this fast-growing market where there continues to be high demand from hyperscaler clients for new capacity, particularly for centrally located sites.

This prime location - situated in the Frankfurt Osthafen area - has been acquired from SAMSON, a leading global supplier of valves, actuators and intelligent flow control systems, which is in the process of moving its headquarters and operations to a new location in Offenbach.

""The successful outcome of our discussions with SAMSON for the future of this exceptional site opens the way for this major new development of a highly sustainable data centre and light industrial campus,"" said Florian Reiff, Managing Director, Tishman Speyer Germany. ""I'd like to thank our partners at Mainova WebHouse and SAMSON for sharing our vision for this important project in a prime urban setting in support of Frankfurt's continued vibrancy.""

Oliver Schiebel, CEO, Mainova WebHouse, added: ""We are looking forward to this joint opportunity of bringing sustainable data centres to a location where they are needed most. Our most sustainable design which already exceeds all the requirements of the latest renewable energy act will be taken to the next level at this location, delivering significant waste heat capacity to Mainova's district heating grid, for the people and businesses in the east of Frankfurt to benefit from carbon neutral district heat.""

Propelling Prague's market

Seznam.cz, a Czech Internet operator and data centre provider, has opened its third data centre in Prague, adding to its existing data centre in Horní Počernice.

The implementation took exactly one year and was carried out in co-operation with Metrostav and general contractors, Altron.

While Seznam.cz has three data centres - Osaka, Nagoya and Kokura - with three data halls, Osaka is leased from O2. In total, up to 6MW of power is planned for the IT equipment at the sites owned.

""Although Kokura 3 is part of the original data centre, it is structurally and technologically a separate unit,"" said Vlastimil Pečínka, Technical Director of Seznam.cz. ""We have been able to introduce several innovations here that are not present in Nagoya, for example, which is only a year old. A significant innovation is that we are leaving out the UPS and batteries on one power branch. Thus, we will fully rely on the redundancy of power supplies in IT technology.""

This change will reduce investment and operating costs and will rely more on its own multi-source power supply. The facility also includes a water treatment plant similar to the Nagoya data centre, which stores rainwater for cooling.

Moving towards greater sustainability and with achieving the same PUE levels of the Nagoya data centre in mind, the warm air extraction system has been modified and further innovations have been made in the cold air distribution system.",intelligentcio.com,news,Intelligent CIO,,0.3019607843137255,454060917,1,https://www.intelligentcio.com/eu/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/05/AdobeStock_403102375-w.jpg,

According to the data compiled by Finbold, the watchdogs have continued their efforts to crack down on privacy violations against European citizens in 2024 and have fined violators a total of €137 million ($149 million) between January 1 and April 30.

The data shows that companies breaching the provisions of GDPR have been paying -- on average -- as much as €1.1 million ($1.2 million) per day through the first 120 days of 2024. In total, 76 penalties have been issued in the four months, with Spain accounting for as many as 30.

During the first full months of 2024, the average amount paid by violating companies was approximately €1.8 million ($1.95 million).

The fines are based on the GDPR Enforcement Tracker, announcements from relevant national regulators, and Finbold's earlier GDPR Fines reports.

Though none of the fines levied in 2024 broke the record set by the Republic of Ireland in 2023 when it compelled Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) to pay €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion), the year nonetheless featured the imposition of multiple large penalties.

According to the official announcement, in early February, Enel Energia -- an electricity and gas supplier -- was penalized by the Italian government for illicitly acquiring private individuals' data for telemarketing purposes. The fine amounted to €79 million ($86 million).

The second-biggest fine -- €32 million ($34.7 million) -- was levied against Amazon France Logistique by France for setting up an inappropriately intrusive surveillance system intended to monitor employees' activity and productivity.

In April, the Czech Republic became responsible for the third-biggest penalty of the year. Avast Software, best known for its antivirus software, was found responsible for forwarding its users' data to a firm called Jumpshot Jumpshot for personalized marketing purposes. As a result, the online security company was compelled to pay a penalty of nearly €14 million ($15 million).

Hellenic Post - the state-owned postal service - became the target of the fourth-largest fine of 2024 when the Greek watchdog found that it had failed to prevent personal data from being leaked to the dark web. In turn, Hellenic Post was forced to pay a penalty of €3 million ($3.2 million).

Finally, the gift-largest penalty was issued to UniCredit Bank by the Italian government. Similar to Hellenic Post, the banking giant was found to have insufficient measures to ensure data security - and has, thus, been the target of a significant cyber attack that led to a large-scale data breach - and was fined €2.8 million ($3 million).

Despite the European regulators' continued efforts to tackle privacy and security issues, the fines levied in the first four months of 2024 highlight the scale of the issue. Indeed, several of the largest penalties issued since the year started pertain to old issues.

For example, the UniCredit Bank cyber attack and data breach took place six years ago in 2018. Similarly, Czech law enforcement confirmed that Avast was forwarding its users' data only in a relatively brief period during 2019.

Similarly, at least a part of the GDPR violations made by Amazon France Logistique targeted temporary workers in April 2020 - a period noted for companies being granted more leeway to offset the hardships of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns.

Ultimately, while the actions of European law enforcement since the start of 2024 highlight the bloc's commitment to ensuring data security and privacy for the people of Europe, the timing of many of the most severe violations showcases the scale of the issue and hints toward possible deficiencies in the system given the apparent tardiness of the fining.

The matter is especially pointed given that the GDPR was passed, in part, to streamline data protection enforcement and expedite the regulators' efforts.",finbold.com,news,Finbold,Andreja Stojanovic,-0.2156862745098039,453983321,1,https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2024/05/GDPR-violators-pay-fines-exceeding-1-million-daily-in-2024.jpg,

Ukrainian MPs are saying that Ukrainian soldiers will later have to participate in other wars on the U.S. side for today's U.S. assistance. Simply put, they will go wherever the Pentagon sends them to suppress rebellious countries of the Global South.

According to Kovalevich, the United States controls all decisions in Ukraine, not only military but also economic. ""It is not the Ukrainian [military] command that decides where to advance, what to undermine, what to shell; Ukrainian soldiers are acting on the advice of Western instructors,"" he said, referring to the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces.

""Militarily, the country is also completely dependent on arms supplies from NATO countries,"" he continued. ""Without them, the Ukrainian army would not last. In fact, the Russian Federation often emphasizes in the media that it is fighting a proxy NATO army,"" Ukraine being only the face of it.

As for the Ukrainian economy, Kovalevich stated that it ""is up to its neck in debt to the IMF and other Western creditors. The country will never be able to pay off these debts. The NATO secretary general [Jens Stoltenberg] recently said that if Ukraine does not win, there will be no point in rebuilding it.""

He also noted that due to draconian conscription laws, a large percentage of Ukrainian men do not hold regular jobs, as otherwise they would be drafted and sent to the front. ""Many people survive thanks to unofficial work,"" he said.

Moreover, many Ukrainians in the diaspora are making all possible efforts to get rid of Ukrainian citizenship and ties to the country ""because the public consensus was forcibly broken in 2014 after the Euromaidan coup,"" he commented.

The pro-U.S. concept of the new Ukrainian state is so unsustainable that it requires Ukrainians to constantly sacrifice their lives, health, [and] property but without offering anything in return and instead cutting social payments, closing hospitals, schools, and businesses as part of the neoliberal course.

Dmitri Kovalevich is a Ukrainian communist, resident of Kiev, and member of the Communist political organization Borotba, which has been banned in Ukraine since the Euromaidan coup of 2014. He is the special correspondent in Ukraine for the news outlet Al-Mayadeen English. In a recent interview with Orinoco Tribune, he discussed the rise of extreme nationalism in the country, the question of autonomy in Donbass and Crimea, NATO using Ukraine as a proxy against Russia, the socio-economic situation in Ukraine, and other issues. The full interview is presented below.

Saheli Chowdhury. How do you view the war in Ukraine? The president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has called it a ""civil war"" considering the ""historical relations"" between the peoples of Russia and Ukraine that go beyond national borders. Is the war really so? What sort of historical relations exist among the peoples of the two countries, and how have they been impacted by the events since the Euromaidan coup of 2014?

Dmitri Kovalevich: To some extent, this is really a civil war because of the closeness of the two nations. In Ukraine, about half of the population is Russian or Russian-speaking Ukrainians. In Russia, Ukrainians are one of the most numerous nations after Russians. There are many ethnic Ukrainians in the Russian government. At the same time, there are many ethnic Russians among Ukrainian nationalists, including Oleksandr Turchynov, who started the war against Donbass in 2014, after a pro-US coup, which was the background for the start of the Russian operation in 2022.

Residents of Ukraine who move to Russia do not need to learn another language or another culture. The same is true for Russian residents who move to Ukraine. In both countries, millions of residents come from mixed families, and an emphasis on Ukrainian or Russian identification more often than not indicates only a political commitment to an ideology of nationalism.

Among the Russian generals who are now leading the offensive in Ukraine, many of them used to serve in the AFU, were born in Ukraine and are Ukrainians. At the same time, the AFU is led by General Alexander Syrsky, a native of Russia, where his parents, supporters of the Russian Federation, live. He still cannot speak Ukrainian language, just as most of Ukrainian leaders who sell nationalism to ordinary citizens. Back in the 1980s, General Syrsky marched in Moscow, in parades in the Red Square.

Traditionally, the events in Ukraine after the Revolution of 1917 have always been interpreted as the Civil War (1918-1920), in which Russian monarchists (""Whites""), Ukrainian and Russian revolutionary forces (Bolsheviks, anarchists, SRs) and Ukrainian nationalists took part.

In addition, ethnic self-identification in Ukraine began to be substituted for political identification after the Euromaidan, which further confuses ordinary residents. In our mass media, one can see such headlines: ""Ukrainians stood up against Moscow popes."" It is about the attack of nationalists on Ukrainian Orthodox believers, most of whom are also Ukrainians. The so-called ""anti-Ukrainian"" position often consists in criticizing the current government. At the same time, Western mercenaries can be declared ""honorary Ukrainians,"" and pacifist ethnic Ukrainians unwilling to take up arms can be declared ""anti-Ukrainians.""

At the same time, Ukraine does not give up its claim to the name Rus, which is related to Russia and Belarus; it just considers Kiev rather than Moscow to be the center of Rus, and Ukrainian nationalists consider Russia itself to be the ""wrong"" and ""Asian"" Russia, contrasting it with the ""European"" Russia, i.e., Ukraine.

SC: The People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of their independence/secession from Ukraine. You have said on different occasions that the people of these regions wanted autonomy, that they were not ""separatists."" What sort of autonomy did they want, and why did they finally secede?

DK: 10 years ago, referendums were held in the regions of Donbass as a result of the Maidan coup in Kiev two months earlier when Viktor Yanukovych, the president of Ukraine, who was originally from Donetsk, was overthrown. In Donbass there was an extremely negative reaction to this coup. Earlier during the Maidan period (2013-2014), there were clashes in Kiev between Maidan and Anti-Maidan participants (the latter were mostly residents of Donbass, Crimea, Odessa, and Kharkiv). This confrontation laid the foundations for further development of the conflict.

This video from March 13, 2014 shows the mass resistance of Donetsk residents against groups of Ukrainian nationalists (among them ultra soccer fans) who came to suppress pro-Soviet sentiments and demolish the Lenin monument in Donetsk, as they had done earlier in Kiev.

Since radical nationalists were the main striking force on the Maidan, it was clear to the residents of south-eastern Ukraine that they would be deprived of some rights due to a coup d'état (their linguistic, cultural, and economic rights).

That is why initially Donbass (short for Donetsk Basin) demanded only autonomy, self-government, the right to decide for themselves what language to speak and which heroes to honor. Rallies for autonomy in Donbass began near monuments to Vladimir Lenin, which nationalists rushed to savagely demolish during the Maidan. The round-the-clock guarding of the Lenin monuments later developed into people's vigilante groups that fought back against the nationalists.

The autonomy of Donbass was prescribed even in the Minsk agreements, which were in force until February 2022. That is, it was assumed that Donbass would return to Ukraine if Ukraine guaranteed its autonomy. However, the Ukrainian authorities were unwilling to do so for two reasons: (1) for Ukrainian nationalists, it was important to finally suppress the movements in Donbass by force in order to avenge the deaths of their nationalist friends; (2) for the West, which financed the new Ukrainian government, it was important to maintain constant tension on the border with the Russian Federation, and preferably a mass exodus of millions of people from Donbass to the Russian Federation to create a social crisis there.

SC: In your latest monthly report on the Ukraine conflict, you mentioned that Crimea had an autonomous government since the 1990s, and that the Ukrainian government control was always weak there. We do not hear about these things nowadays. Could you describe what that autonomous governance meant for Crimea, and if that was an important factor for the peninsula to rejoin Russia in March 2014 through a referendum?

DK: Crimea was given to Ukraine by Nikita Khrushchev in 1954 as a sign of friendship between the Ukrainian and Russian people on the 300th anniversary of the signing in 1654 of a treaty on the transfer of part of the territories of present-day Ukraine from the Polish kingdom to the kingdom of Russia (which was the result of a long peasant war and a religious war).

However, the transition to the Ukrainian SSR did not really mean anything for Crimea until 1991. After the collapse of the USSR, Crimea, where the Ukrainian population was always small, held a referendum on the creation of autonomy as a separate part of the USSR. Ukraine (still part of the USSR at the time) recognized its autonomous status. In this status, Crimea soon became part of Ukraine as well.

Until 2014, Ukraine's power was indeed weak on the peninsula. On the other hand, Crimea received practically nothing from the center (Kiev), as a result of which the infrastructure and monuments there gradually fell into disrepair (as well as throughout Ukraine).

After 2014, the secession of Crimea and the Donbass republics, along with the migration of hundreds of thousands of people from other regions, shifted the political balance in Ukraine -- in the remaining part, nationalists and supporters of NATO and the EU could claim at least half of the votes. Nationalists in Ukraine have since repeatedly said that they only want the territories, but not the people living on those territories. This attitude, expressed in the media, only strengthened the resistance of the inhabitants of these regions.

Regional divisions intensified in all former Soviet republics after the collapse of the Soviet Union also as a result of deteriorating living standards and, consequently, increased internal competition.

SC: In regards to referendums, the Donetsk and Lugansk Republics joined the Russian Federation through a referendum in September 2022. However, according to residents of the Donbass, who spoke to the press during the vote, this was not the first referendum in the region. If so, when did the previous referendums take place, and what were they about: autonomy or secession?

DK: The first referendum in Donbas was held in 1994 simultaneously with parliamentary elections in Ukraine. The main question was about recognizing Ukraine as a federation, which implied a certain autonomy of the provinces (as in the Russian Federation, Germany, the USA, India, Brazil, etc.).

Residents of Donetsk and Lugansk regions then also spoke in favor of recognizing Russian as a second state language and strengthening economic ties with Russia (Russia was the main buyer of Donbass enterprises' products). The overwhelming majority then favored federation, a second state language, and stronger ties with Russia.

In 2014, two referendums were held -- in Donetsk and Lugansk regions. The referendum included a single question in two languages (Russian and Ukrainian): ""Do you support the act of state self-rule ('samostoyatel'nost') of the Donetsk/Lugansk People's Republic?"". Two options were offered: ""Yes"" and ""No.""

The term ""samostoyatel'nost"" used in the question can imply both full state sovereignty and autonomy/self-rule within a state entity. Russia then recommended postponing the referendum in order not to complicate the situation, but it was held.

The next referendum was held in 2022 and concerned joining the Russian Federation, but exactly as republics (DPR and LPR) -- autonomous republics with all the attributes of republics preserved.

In other words, for the nationalist policy of Ukraine, federalization was equated long ago with ""separatism,"" demands for autonomy were suppressed for the sake of unification of the state, while the Russian Federation respectfully treats autonomies, republics within its composition with their national languages, cultural peculiarities, and economic ties.

The federal structure of Ukraine, with its linguistic and cultural diversity, would prevent Ukraine's sharp turn after the coup toward NATO and the severing of ties with Russia, China, and Iran. Diversity and federal structure just complicate any sharp turn.

SC: This year is the 10th anniversary of the Euromaidan coup. How has this ""milestone"" been commemorated in Ukraine -- both by the government and by the people?

DK: In Ukraine, during martial law, all mass meetings are banned because they are considered unsafe. Although radical nationalists periodically organize their marches, they are not touched, as they form the main pillar of the government. But there were no significant events these days. All attention in Ukraine is focused on the events on the front, mass conscription, and pleas to the U.S. and EU to give more money. The events of the Maidan have taken a back seat to this and the criminal cases of the Maidan period are bogged down in years-long legal proceedings.

Ukrainian media and officials try every day to excite the tired population with emotional appeals, hysterical proclamations that ordinary people are more likely to tune out, to stop perceiving the media and forget even about the events of a year ago, not to mention Euromaidan.

However, once Ukrainians manage to escape from their homeland, they usually stop being interested in it. A recent survey, for example, showed that half of the Ukrainians living in Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic are not interested in events in Ukraine and have no plans to ever return there.

To some extent, it can be said that even getting rid of Ukrainian citizenship and ties to the current state of Ukraine has become an obsession for millions of its citizens. This is because the public consensus was forcibly broken in 2014 after the Euromaidan coup. Most Ukrainians wanted to just live, work, and be harassed less by the state. The pro-US concept of the new Ukrainian state (after Euromaidan) is so unsustainable that it requires Ukrainians to constantly sacrifice their lives, health, [and] property but without offering anything in return and instead cutting social payments, closing hospitals, schools, and businesses as part of the neoliberal course.

SC: May 2, 2024 completed 10 years of the Odessa Trade Union House massacre. What is the current situation in Odessa, which has a significant Russian population? Is there any pro-autonomy movement in Odessa and in other Russian-majority regions of Ukraine?

DK: Since 2014, many Odessa residents have migrated to the Russian Federation. In Donbass, they even formed the backbone of some armed formations of the republics. In general, people have been leaving Ukraine by the thousands in recent years for various reasons, both political and economic. Now in Odessa, as nowhere else in Ukraine, there is forced conscription -- men are caught on the streets every day and forcibly sent to the front. Thousands of men are fleeing daily through the Odessa region to Moldova and Romania, so there are hundreds of cars abandoned along the border. Ukrainian authorities are now digging ditches along the border and putting up rows of fences with barbed wire to prevent men from fleeing, as there is almost no one left to fight in the country.

Russian and Ukrainian media periodically write about acts of sabotage on the railroads, which they attribute to Odessa partisans, but I cannot confirm this. During the years of repression and far-right terror, any opposition movement in Ukraine, if it exists, has been driven deep underground.

Ukrainian security services also periodically create ""decoys"" -- fake resistance groups that are tasked with identifying disloyal citizens.

On the other hand, now, both in Russia and in the EU, there are millions in diasporas of Ukrainian citizens -- residents of Odessa, Kiev, Kharkiv, Lviv -- former drivers who leave the country for humanitarian supplies and never return, former police officers, defected military personnel, and ordinary farmers. If we do not take into account the elderly, who usually don't like to migrate, there are now more Ukrainians outside Ukraine than inside.

SC: What is the situation of the people of Ukraine, how are they living their daily lives? What is the general view towards the government of the country, how much support does Zelensky still have?

DK: Any war always implies the presence of a small group of people who profit from it, from stealing humanitarian supplies, weapons, foreign aid. In this respect, a small part of Ukrainians, close to the elite, has enriched itself considerably. In no country in Europe can you see as many expensive cars in a day as in Kiev. For this category of the population, it is important that the war be eternal.

The population remaining in Ukraine is divided into those who are fighting and relatives of the dead and wounded on one side and those who have not been touched by the war. The authorities are skillfully manipulating, pitting one group against the other. This is presented under the guise of ""justice."" According to the logic that the Ukrainian authorities instill in the population, if one part of the population has suffered, then all others should suffer as well. Such manipulations help them to divert dissatisfaction from themselves and their corruption, in particular.

Naturally, living standards in Ukraine have dropped significantly, although it was already the poorest country in the European continent, competing with neighboring Moldova for this title. Ukrainian internally displaced persons were recently paid $50 a month, but had to pay $40 for light and water in hostels for the displaced. This spring, that $50 was taken away from them as well. The authorities explain away the reduction of payments and the closure of hospitals and schools as military needs. On the other hand, the Ukrainian economy survives solely on external loans from Western countries, which are issued so that Kiev can partially repay previous loans.

Ukrainian men cannot go abroad now, but they cannot get a job legally either (if they do, they are immediately taken into the army). Many people survive thanks to unofficial work.

Attitudes towards Zelensky personally and Ukrainian politicians are difficult to trace, as people are afraid to answer questions. Social services in Ukraine cater exclusively to representatives of the authorities. Recently, for example, a poll by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology showed that the overwhelming majority of Ukrainians are ready to accept an increase in electricity prices even though people already owe billions in electricity bills. This only shows that the polls are bogus. On the streets, people are afraid to discuss political and military issues, and Ukraine's security services intimidate them even more by daily detaining even children who have expressed any kind of negative thoughts about Zelensky or NATO.

SC: Why do you think the Zelensky government is attacking civilians not only in the Donbass but also in the Russian border provinces of Belgorod, Kursk, and Bryansk, while the Ukrainian armed forces go on losing on the battlefield?

DK: The target of the entire operation of overthrowing the Ukrainian government in 2014 and the subsequent war with Donbass is not Ukraine, but Russia. It is important for the West to provoke discontent, coup, or social tension inside the Russian Federation. The Ukrainian attacks have been suicidal, but it is not the Ukrainian command that decides where to advance, what to undermine, what to shell. Ukrainian soldiers are acting on the advice of Western instructors.

Ukrainian MPs are even saying that Ukrainian soldiers will later have to participate in other wars on the U.S. side for today's U.S. assistance. Simply put, they will go wherever the Pentagon sends them to suppress rebel movements in the countries of the Global south.

In fact, Ukraine has become a private mercenary company of NATO which exists only to fight against NATO opponents.

SC: How much US/NATO influence is felt in Ukraine -- in the war as well as in the economy and the political life of the country?

DK: The Ukrainian economy is ruined, and the country is up to its neck in debt to the IMF and other Western creditors. The country will never be able to pay off these debts. The NATO secretary general recently said that if Ukraine does not win, there will be no point in rebuilding it. Militarily, the country is also completely dependent on arms supplies from NATO countries. Without them, the Ukrainian army would not last. In turn, the Russian Federation also often emphasizes in the media that they are fighting a proxy NATO army, demilitarizing the NATO bloc itself. There are several thousand mercenaries from NATO countries fighting in Ukraine. There are also some mercenaries from Colombia fighting in the neo-Nazi battalion Carpathian Sich.

In addition, the Ukrainian authorities make all economic decisions, from the level of water tariffs to cutting benefits for the wounded, based on the recommendations of the embassies of Western countries (mainly the U.S. and Britain, the other NATO countries have no influence). Ukrainians are told that they are in no position to refuse. Simply put, if the United States gives them a loan, they will pay the salaries of Ukrainian teachers this month; if it does not, they will not give them salaries or advise them to quit.

SC: How do you envision the end of the war? Do you think Ukraine would lose more territory, in addition to the four provinces that already became part of Russia since September 2022? Is there a possibility that NATO might get fully involved in the war, and even the ""nuclear option"" may be invoked?

DK: Yes, I suppose Ukraine will lose more territory, though I think it will be preserved as a state with exorbitant foreign debts hanging over it. Putin recently talked about a cordon sanitaire to keep Russian territories safe from shelling and invasions, followed by a new offensive in Kharkov region in May 2024. I do not think NATO as a bloc will dare to go directly against a nuclear-armed country, but perhaps when they run out of Ukrainian troops, more troops from Eastern European countries and other U.S. satellites will be sent to Ukraine. What is at stake for the West, after all, is the preservation of its global hegemony and the ability to dictate terms to the countries of the Global South.",mronline.org,news,MR Online,"Paul Burkett, Zhao Dingqi",-0.2156862745098039,453914115,4,https://f3b9m7v4.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Donetsk-May-11-liberation-celebration-copy.jpg,eng-9575330

Woodburn will build and operate a 2.4 MW photovoltaic array on one of Magna Bohemia's factories in the Czech Republic, supported by the 15-year PPA.

The company said it is actively looking to introduce PPAs to companies in Croatia and the surrounding region.

In July last year, Woodburn started works on a 10 MW solar power plant in Brdovac in the Zagreb area and another facility of 3 MW in Stankovci in the Zadar county in Dalmatia.

Woodburn's Head of Development Mirko Medenica noted that the PPA was signed one month after it participated in the RE-Source Croatia conference in Zagreb.

Woodburn is installing two solar power plants in Croatia

""We are actively looking to introduce our PPAs to companies in Croatia and the region. Our PPAs will be powered by our upcoming plants in Stankovci and Brdovec, as well as several other renewable energy plants that are in the pipeline, that are yet to be announced, along with other partnerships,"" he stated.

According to Woodburn's CFO Chris Kottnaeur, there are multiple advantages of a long-term PPA for customers.

""From a business cash-flow perspective, the single largest benefit is that customers do not have any capital expenditure investments. By signing the PPA, the only cost they have is operational expenditure, which additionally, given the fixed period of the contract, ensures that long-term budgeting of a key production and operating cost - electricity - becomes very easy, with the stress of pricing fluctuations and associated write-downs,"" Kottnauer stressed.

The PV facility in BiH will be accompanied with battery

Apart from the Czech Magna PPA, Woodburn already has five completed projects, with over EUR 80 million invested to date in biomass and solar projects.

It recently announced its first investment in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a concession agreement signed with Canton 10.

The 92.5 MW solar power plant is set to be built in Tomislavgrad.

Cuban researcher praises President Ho Chi Minh's ideology

President Ho Chi Minh is a figure with universal stature, a great revolutionary who fought tirelessly for the best for Vietnamese people and humanity, and a very great but humble man, said Dr. Ruvislei González Sáez, one of the leading researchers on Vietnam in Latin America.

In a recent interview granted to the Vietnam News Agency on the occasion of the 134th birthday of the late leader (May 19, 1890-2024), Saez, who is also Vice President of the Cuba-Vietnam Friendship Association, affirmed that the great ideology of President Ho Chi Minh, one of the most important figures in the 20th century, has remained alive among the 100 million Vietnamese people and revolutionaries in the world.

According to the Cuban researcher, the late leader's ideology has gone beyond the borders of Vietnam and had a great influence on all humanity.

He stressed that he is especially impressed with the simple, humble and closeness manner of President Ho Chi Minh.

The Cuban scholar said that his organisation, the Cuban Institute of Friendship with the Peoples (ICAP), and the Havana University hope to conduct more intensive studies on the Ho Chi Minh ideology and promote the Vietnamese leader's legacy in the new era.

President Ho Chi Minh was born on May 19, 1890 in Kim Lien commune, Nam Dan district, the central province of Nghe An. He devoted his whole life to the cause of national liberation, while tirelessly striving for peace and progress around the world.

He led the struggle for national independence and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, now the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, in 1945.

The President passed away in 1969. His body was embalmed and placed in a glass coffin inside a granite mausoleum in the capital city of Hanoi.

British historian praises President Ho Chi Minh's role in national liberation

It is hard to see national liberation, reunification or path through peace and independence of Vietnam as a nation without the presence of President Ho Chi Minh and the stamp of his personality, British historian John Callow has said in a recent interview with the Vietnam News Agency on the occasion of the 134th birthday the later leader.

""Ho Chi Minh was an incredible figure on so many different levels: man of action, revolutionary, patriot, scholar, poet, politician, theorist and great Marxist, having all of these in his make-up, blended together like veins of gold running through him,"" stated John Callow.

According to the historian, Ho Chi Minh was a forerunner who he was on the road to where he wanted to be, to the great vision of unification. He laid a very clear road map to bring freedom, and prosperity to his country and people.

At times in his early career, Ho Chi Minh stood absolutely alone, the British scholar said, citing when he was at the founding conference of the Communist Party of France in the streets of Paris taking his message to the League of Nations appeals on behalf of the Vietnamese people who did not yet have a state. He always carried with him the vision of better days ahead and sought to achieve it.

""It was a long, incredibly rich career that saw him constantly learning, adapting, evolving, always carrying the people with him, always having a sense of what was new, of how the West and its industry and its ideas could not submerge Vietnam, but how those positive elements within it could enhance what was already there in Vietnamese culture,"" he noted.

The historian further said that is one of the secrets of the greatness of Ho Chi Minh, a man who could combine so many facets, a leader in the richest and most democratic sense of that word who could inspire people, who understood world culture and Vietnamese culture and combined the progressive legacies of Confucianism alongside the positive legacies of the West. Ho Chi Minh's Marxism was not a dogma, was not something that could not be approved upon or applied, but was a guide to action that was creative, that could be individually tailored, and used above all in the service of the people.

For all these facts, Ho Chi Minh was truly remarkable. A world statesman of the highest calibre who understood socialist internationalism to his fingertips, who always saw unity- unity of the Party, of the people, but also of the wider socialist movement, he stated.

Speaking about Ho Chi Minh Thought, Callow said his writings, the four little volumes produced in the English language during the 1960s and the 1970s, are incredibly rich and varied. They deal with day to day topics, living in the moment, the problems of fighting imperialism, the problems of building in the future, items of Vietnamese traditional culture, the roles of religion, of women, and of the family.

According to Callow, there is nothing that his Thought does not touch, and within all of this, it is a creative conversation with his readership, with the people. It provides a spur to action, but also a very firm moral compass, rooted in the people, in the land, in the alliance with the small peasantry themselves. And all of these were the preconditions for victory, for transformation, for statehood, for breaking the shackles of empire and domination, and for removing the racism that had been vested upon the Vietnamese people, under French, and then under American colonisation.

The British scholar pointed out on all kinds of levels, President Ho Chi Minh's message is freeing people, freeing their minds, freeing the chains of poverty, of absolute poverty, of subjugation, of allowing the nation to enjoy its full riches, to escape a poverty not only that is absolute in terms of having a good standard of living, but also a mental poverty being shackled into a colonial deferential mindset.

In his opinion, President Ho Chi Minh's Thought is truly remarkable, because it folds just like the finely tempered steel of a metal blade, with so many different sources and ideas. Ho Chi Minh, whose father was a Confucian scholar, has seen Vietnamese traditional culture. But also he had been to Europe, and in that experience of really being in the centre of the European Enlightenment thought, the world of Spinoza as well as Marx or Lenin, never once did he abandon his own host culture.

He never lost sight of his people or their great cultural gains. So everything he learned, everything he brought back, the version of Marxism that he forged through the struggle of the Independence War, was a creative process where he was able to take the very best from Western thought and philosophy and economics and marry it to Vietnamese traditional culture.

""This has made Ho Chi Minh Thought so durable. It was a process to seeing the world, a guide to action, and a series of principles. He pointed out that has what has enabled the Party and people of Vietnam to go forward in a creative manner, to surmount the terrible difficulties they've had since the late 1980s, to survive in a world that so often is hostile to them, to creatively apply the principles of Doi Moi (Renewal),"" he said.

The historian said today Vietnam is changing, being on the global scene and operating in global markets. The country has recovered itself splendidly and its young vibrant population deserve the good things in life. He believed President Ho Chi Minh's creative dynamic could lead seamlessly to the achievements of national liberation through the terrible fights that inspired generations of Vietnamese to follow in his flame, to follow in his path, to make those sacrifices for a better world.

Cuba, Vietnam boost cooperation in justice

A delegation from the Supreme People's Court led by its Deputy Chief Justice Nguyen Van Tien made an official visit to Cuba from May 13- to May 18 to foster bilateral ties and attend the 11th International Meeting of Justice and Law.

At a working session with Chief Justice of the Supreme People's Court of Cuba Rubén Remigio Ferro, Tien highlighted the developments in judicial cooperation between the two countries and informed the host about main reforms in the Vietnamese court system in recent times, including fine-tuning institutions, reforming judicial administrative procedures, building electronic courts and applying information technology in court activities.

In its long-term judicial reform strategy, Vietnam aims for a people-centred justice, improve judge capacity, and build electronic courts and strengthen international experience exchange, Tien said.

He also emphasized the need for the two countries to continue to cultivate and develop the close-knit relationship between their court systems in the time ahead.

For his part, the Cuban chief justice shared the orientation for the modernization of the Cuban court system, and noted the similar points in the process of revamping the judicial system in the two countries.

Showing his interest in Vietnam's experience in judicial reconciliation, Ferro suggested launching knowledge exchanges or thematic workshops on the issue to better tap the similarities between the two countries.

On the occasion, the Vietnamese official handed over some laptops as a gift from the Vietnam Supreme People's Court to the Cuban counterpart.

The 11th International Meeting of Justice and Law, which ran from May 15-17 in Havana, drew the participation of some 400 delegates from Cuba and other countries.

Discussions primarily focused on issues related to population aging, the legality and impartiality of judges in the administration of justice; the interpretation of the Law, family, civil and administrative matters; and the response to domestic and gender violence.

During their stay in Cuba, the Vietnamese delegation attended a flower offering ceremony in commemoration of the 134th birthday of President Ho Chi Minh at a park named after Ho Chi Minh in Havana and visit the Fidel Castro Centre.

HCM City prepares for rainy season

HCM City has finished many flood-control projects to fight flooding in the coming rainy season.

After the city suffered months of heat waves, some heavy rains hit the densely-populated southern metropolis. However, heavy rain also caused flooding on many roads in the city.

According to the city's Department of Construction, the city has had 18 flooded roads (13 roads flooded due to rain and five roads flooded due to high tide).

The specific list of 13 main roads flooded by rain includes Phan Anh, Lê Đức Thọ, Quang Trung, Nguyễn Văn Khối (Cây Trâm), Hồ Học Lãm, National Highway No.1, Đặng Thị Rành, Dương Văn Cam, Kha Vạn Cân, Bạch Đằng, Thảo Điền, Quốc Hương and Nguyễn Văn Hưởng.

Meanwhile, the list of flooded roads due to high tide includes Huỳnh Tấn Phát, Trần Xuân Soạn, Lê Văn Lương, Đào Sư Tích and Highway 50.

In fact, many places not on this list were flooded. On the afternoon of May 8, after only about 15 minutes of rain, some areas in Thủ Đức City were flooded, including Lê Văn Việt, Tô Ngọc Vân and Võ Văn Ngân streets, and Hà Nội Highway.

Mai Hữu Quyết, vice chairman of Thủ Đức City People's Committee, commented that Võ Văn Ngân street is a heavily flooded area of Thủ Đức City in recent years.

In the near future, Thủ Đức City will have many renovation projects to solve the overall problem of flooding in the locality.

Besides Võ Văn Ngân Street, the city will strive to start and complete seven projects to upgrade anti-flood embankments, 36 drainage projects, and expand 60 alleys.

To prepare for the rainy season, the city's Department of Construction said it has planned to put into operation a series of flood-control projects.

The department plans to operate 380 tidal check valves, and five mobile pumping stations with a capacity from 1,000 cubic metres (cu.m) of water per hour to 2,000cu.m of water per hour.

Along with 380 tidal check valves and five mobile pumping stations, ten other pumping stations and large tide control gates in Bình Triệu, Bình Lợi, Lăng Canal, Nhảy - Ruột Ngựa Canal, Nhiêu Lộc - Thị Nghè, Bà Tiếng Canal, Phú Lâm, Thanh Đa, Mễ Cốc 1 and Mễ Cốc 2 will be operated synchronously to mitigate flooding from high tide.

In addition, the department and relevant units have implemented projects to build and renovate drainage systems to solve flooding on 18 main roads such as Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh, Tân Quý, Ba Vân, Trương Công Định, Bàu Cát, Lê Đức Thọ, Quang Trung, Nguyễn Văn Khối, Đặng Thị Rành and Bạch Đằng streets in Bình Thạnh District; Thảo Điền, Quốc Hương, Nguyễn Văn Hưởng, Dương Văn Cam and Kha Vạn Cân streets and the National Highway 1A section in Thủ Đức City; and Phan Anh and Hồ Học Lãm streets in districts 6, 8 and Bình Tân.

Lý Thanh Long, chief of staff of the city Department of Construction, said that the city is preparing to do three projects to prevent flooding and improve drainage pipes in Gò Vấp District.

These projects include improving the drainage system of Nguyễn Van Khối - Lê Văn Thọ Street, Quang Trung Street (from Phạm Văn Chiêu to Chợ Cầu bridge) and Lê Đức Thọ Street (from Phạm Văn Chiêu to Cụt bridge).

In addition, the department has directed the city Technical Infrastructure Management Centre to repair degraded sewers, and dredge sewer beds and canals, Long said.

The city is also preparing to invest in four projects including the Hy Vọng Canal renovation project, the Văn Thánh Canal dredging and improvement project, and Bà Lớn Canal drainage project.

The project to dredge, build infrastructure, and improve the environment on the bank of Đôi Canal in District 8 is expected to start and be completed in the period 2026-2030.

Summer vacation safety concerns for Hà Nội students

With summer vacation just around the corner, many parents in Hà Nội are already worrying about how to keep their children safe and engaged during the long break.

Some parents are concerned about their children spending too much time indoors glued to electronic devices, while others worry about the risk of drowning or other accidents.

Nguyễn Bích Hạnh, whose youngest child attends kindergarten in Cầu Giấy District, said she has to send him to her parent's house for childcare during the summer vacation as she and her husband are too busy working.

""We have to send our little one to stay with his grandparents for peace of mind,"" said Hạnh. ""Leaving her home alone is not an option because we cannot ensure proper supervision to prevent accidents.""

Phạm Thu Hiên from Ba Đình District is at a loss for what to do with her son during the summer break. She is worried that he would spend all his time watching TV and glued to his smartphone if she left him at home.

""Social media exposes kids to so much inappropriate content that it's hard to monitor,"" said Hiên.

But she is also not at ease sending him to the countryside because there are many ponds and lakes. Her only option now seems to be enrolling him in swimming and martial arts classes.

To alleviate parents' concerns about their children's summer activities, the Hà Nội's Department of Education has issued a plan to organise the activities for students.

The plan requires schools to collaborate with local HCM Youth Union and Young Pioneers' Councils to ensure students are properly supervised and engaged in safe community activities during the summer break.

The department also requested schools to allow students to access school facilities such as libraries and gyms during the off-school period for studying and recreation.

Regarding academic studies, schools in Hà Nội are strictly prohibited from organising extra classes or supplemental instruction during the summer break. Summer academic review is solely reserved for students with subpar academic performance.

Water safety remains a pressing concern as drowning incidents tragically claim young lives each summer.

Many schools have installed ""smart swimming pools"" to offer swimming lessons and water safety training. Local authorities also organise courses on drowning prevention, survival skills, and emergency response in this regard.

Nguyễn Hồng Thúy, Principal of Tâm Tiến Junior School in Chương Mỹ District, highlighted the importance of parent-school cooperation in caring for students.

She said even though students are not in school during the summer break, the school remains actively involved, instructing teachers to keep an eye on their students and collaborating with their parents during the year-end summary meeting to discuss summer vacation-related matters.

Parents are particularly encouraged to keep a close watch their children and minimise potential risks that could lead to accidents or injuries during the summer.

HCM City strives to complete HCM City - Mộc Bài Expressway by 2027

The Prime Minister expects to approve the investment policy of the HCM City - Mộc Bài expressway project this week, allowing the city to start the project before April 30, 2025, and complete it by the end of 2027.

Phan Văn Mãi, chairman of the municipal People's Committee said the new expressway was expected to reduce traffic pressure on National Highway No. 22 and contribute to the economic and social development of the city, Tây Ninh Province, and neighboring countries as well as shorten the travel time of passenger and freight transport between the southeastern region and Cambodia via Mộc Bài International Border Gate.

After the Prime Minister approves the investment policy, HCM City would urgently carry out tasks such as site clearance, investor selection, and other preparatory work to ensure the project could start construction before April 30 next year.

The construction project of the HCM City - Mộc Bài expressway in the form of PPP has a total length of around 50 kilometers in the first phase.

The expressway will start from Ring Road 3, Củ Chi District, span over the Vàm Cỏ River and link up to Mộc Bài International Border Gate in Tây Ninh Province's Bến Cầu District.

Short film project attracts young filmmakers

Young filmmakers are encouraged to join the CJ Short Film Making Project 2024, a national contest that targets young Vietnamese film talents by the CJ Cultural Foundation and CGV Việt Nam.

The event's theme is ""Thời Khắc Vàng- Toả Sáng Đam Mê"" (The Golden Time - Shine for the Best), and it aims to help young filmmakers learn and develop their careers.

It will give financial support worth VNĐ1.5 billion (US$58,935) for the best five film projects.

Candidates should send their entries to the contest by May 31 at http://duanphimngancj.cgv.vn.

Famous directors and producers, such as Trịnh Đình Lê Minh, Trần Thị Bích Ngọc and Hàm Trần, are invited to become mentors during the filmmaking process.

Independent director Phan Đăng Di of Hà Nội is also included.

The mentors will train and share information, skills and experience in film, including casting, shooting, and pre- and post-production.

They will help to ensure that the productions from the event meet qualifications for international film festivals.

""Through the CJ Short Film Making Project 2024, we hope young filmmakers, amateur and professional, will have a chance to complete their dream and introduce their art to the world,"" said Ko Jae Soo, director of CJ CGV Việt Nam.

The CJ Short Film Making Project began in 2018 and aims to bring works by young Vietnamese filmmakers to international film festivals.

The contest's entries have featured different genres, and various topics and stories covering love, life and humanity.

Its best films have been selected to screen and compete at over 50 international film festivals around the world.

One of the contest's highlighted winners is Phạm Ngọc Lân, who graduated from the Hà Nội University of Architecture but later followed his passion to make independent films.

Lân won the Best Film at the International Competition for Fiction & Documentaries at the 16th VIS Vienna Shorts Festival in Austria in 2019, one year after winning at the CJ Short Film Making Project.

His 19-minute black and white film, Một Khu Đất Tốt (Blessed Land) tells the story of a mother and son looking for a father's tomb at a cemetery.

The work also won Special Mention Award from the jury at the International Shorts Competition at the 20th Las Palmas de Gran Canaria International Film Festival in the Canary Islands in 2019.

His previous film, Cu Li Never Cries, received the Hubert Bals Fund for Script Development at the 2017 International Film Festival Rotterdam, and was chosen for the L'Atelier Cinefondation at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival.

High-quality science, technology human resources key to sustainable growth

To achieve sustainable development and help the economy take off, high-quality human resources and advancements in science and technology should be seen as key components, according to insiders.

Prof. Dr. Nguyen Dinh Duc - Chairman of the University Council of University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University-Hanoi, said in many industries, especially in manufacturing where the highest concentration of FDI projects are located, the rate of employed and trained workers is limited.

Dr. Tran Van Khai, a standing member of the Committee for Science, Technology and Environment of the National Assembly, said the development of high-quality human resources has recorded good results in recent times.

Vietnam has established policies to attract and retain talent, experts, and highly skilled workers through attractive salary, bonus, and welfare policies, he said, noting that attention has been paid to training and developing high-quality human resources.

The number of entrepreneurs and skilled workers is increasing, importantly contributing to the country's development, he added.

However, the structure of vocational training has not closely aligned with the labour market's demand, especially in emerging economic sectors. At the same time, there is a shortage of labourers in spearhead economic sectors and those serving the digital economy.

Khai stressed that it is urgent to build breakthrough policies to address existing shortcomings and limitations that are hindering the development of high-quality human resources and labour productivity.

For the semiconductor industry, the latest report from the Ministry of Planning and Investment indicates that Vietnam needs to train 50,000 - 100,000 high-quality workers for the sector from 2025 to 2030.

According to Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha, to train tens of thousands of high-quality workers in the industry, priority must be given to training and attracting high-quality teachers and lecturers with deep expertise.

Emphasising the crucial role of human resources and promoting scientific research activities in implementing the goal of strengthening national competitiveness and innovation capacity, Minister of Science and Technology Huynh Thanh Dat said ministries will continue to improve policies and encourage a favourable environment for scientists at universities to maximise their research capacity.

Universities should also prioritise substantial investments in improving the quality of undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as developing high-quality scientific and technological human resources, he said.

The minister also suggested the National Foundation for Science and Technology research and direct sponsorship programmes to strongly promote outstanding research groups and develop high-level scientific and technological research human resources, especially young talent./.

Vietnam, AFD strengthen cooperation, promote energy transition

Vietnam wants to deepen the traditional reliable relations and strategic partnership with France, particularly the French Development Agency (AFD), said Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha while receiving AFD Deputy Director General Marie-Hélène Loison in Hanoi.

During the reception, Ha appreciated the results of AFD's activities in Vietnam as well as changes in its organisational apparatus for wider and more effective access to new development fields.

Ha said that besides institutionalising mechanisms and policies on green transition and just energy transition, Vietnam needs advice on techniques, institutional improvement, technology selection, governance models, and financial resources in the fields of energy, transportation, agriculture, and urban areas.

Such advice will help Vietnam to determine actual needs, and plans for effective use of domestic resources, loans, and sponsorship sources, Ha said.

He noted that AFD's studies on green transition, climate change response, and energy transition will provide ""solution packages"" for investment, science and technology, and technical infrastructure development in Vietnam.

Regarding green transition and just energy transition, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Government of Vietnam is discussing with partners to soon pilot several offshore wind power projects, adding the country also promotes the participation of the private sector in renewable electricity production.

""AFD's research results can also support French businesses to find investment and business cooperation projects in Vietnam,"" Ha said.

For her part, Marie-Hélène Loison affirmed that AFD and its partners are always ready to provide technical advice and support for Vietnam to improve the legal framework, find financial sources to implement important socio-economic development programmes and projects in Vietnam, especially in the fields of energy transition, climate change response, and green transition.

Since 2019, AFD has coordinated with the Vietnamese side to implement a project to research the socio-economic impacts of climate change in Vietnam and the climate change adaptation strategy. The two sides have launched Phase 2 of the project with priority given to assessing the socio-economic impacts of the energy transition process in Vietnam./.",vietnamnet.vn,news,VietNamNet News,,0.2078431372549019,453870503,4,https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2024/5/20/vietnam-news-headlines-may-202024-159608d9ecca448ebae530335aaa1791-1045.webp?width=0&s=AvEkvSV_kLtX-UddoIIJEg,eng-9582238

""Ukrainian MPs are saying that Ukrainian soldiers will later have to participate in other wars on the US side for today's US assistance. Simply put, they will go wherever the Pentagon sends them to suppress rebellious countries of the Global South.""

According to Kovalevich, the United States controls all decisions in Ukraine, not only military but also economic. ""It is not the Ukrainian [military] command that decides where to advance, what to undermine, what to shell; Ukrainian soldiers are acting on the advice of Western instructors,"" he said, referring to the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces.

""Militarily, the country is also completely dependent on arms supplies from NATO countries,"" he continued. ""Without them, the Ukrainian army would not last. In fact, the Russian Federation often emphasizes in the media that it is fighting a proxy NATO army,"" Ukraine being only the face of it.

As for the Ukrainian economy, Kovalevich stated that it ""is up to its neck in debt to the IMF and other Western creditors. The country will never be able to pay off these debts. The NATO secretary general [Jens Stoltenberg] recently said that if Ukraine does not win, there will be no point in rebuilding it.""

He also noted that due to draconian conscription laws, a large percentage of Ukrainian men do not hold regular jobs, as otherwise they would be drafted and sent to the front. ""Many people survive thanks to unofficial work,"" he said.

Moreover, many Ukrainians in the diaspora are making all possible efforts to get rid of Ukrainian citizenship and ties to the country ""because the public consensus was forcibly broken in 2014 after the Euromaidan coup,"" he commented. ""The pro-US concept of the new Ukrainian state is so unsustainable that it requires Ukrainians to constantly sacrifice their lives, health, [and] property but without offering anything in return and instead cutting social payments, closing hospitals, schools, and businesses as part of the neoliberal course.""

Dmitri Kovalevich is a Ukrainian communist, resident of Kiev, and member of the Communist political organization Borotba, which has been banned in Ukraine since the Euromaidan coup of 2014. He is the special correspondent in Ukraine for the news outlet Al-Mayadeen English. In a recent interview with Orinoco Tribune, he discussed the rise of extreme nationalism in the country, the question of autonomy in Donbass and Crimea, NATO using Ukraine as a proxy against Russia, the socio-economic situation in Ukraine, and other issues. The full interview is presented below.

1. How do you view the war in Ukraine? The president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has called it a ""civil war"" considering the ""historical relations"" between the peoples of Russia and Ukraine that go beyond national borders. Is the war really so? What sort of historical relations exist among the peoples of the two countries, and how have they been impacted by the events since the Euromaidan coup of 2014?

To some extent, this is really a civil war because of the closeness of the two nations. In Ukraine, about half of the population is Russian or Russian-speaking Ukrainians. In Russia, Ukrainians are one of the most numerous nations after Russians. There are many ethnic Ukrainians in the Russian government. At the same time, there are many ethnic Russians among Ukrainian nationalists, including Oleksandr Turchynov, who started the war against Donbass in 2014, after a pro-US coup, which was the background for the start of the Russian operation in 2022.

Residents of Ukraine who move to Russia do not need to learn another language or another culture. The same is true for Russian residents who move to Ukraine. In both countries, millions of residents come from mixed families, and an emphasis on Ukrainian or Russian identification more often than not indicates only a political commitment to an ideology of nationalism.

Among the Russian generals who are now leading the offensive in Ukraine, many of them used to serve in the AFU, were born in Ukraine and are Ukrainians. At the same time, the AFU is led by General Alexander Syrsky, a native of Russia, where his parents, supporters of the Russian Federation, live. He still cannot speak Ukrainian language, just as most of Ukrainian leaders who sell nationalism to ordinary citizens. Back in the 1980s, General Syrsky marched in Moscow, in parades in the Red Square.

Traditionally, the events in Ukraine after the Revolution of 1917 have always been interpreted as the Civil War (1918-1920), in which Russian monarchists (""Whites""), Ukrainian and Russian revolutionary forces (Bolsheviks, anarchists, SRs) and Ukrainian nationalists took part.

In addition, ethnic self-identification in Ukraine began to be substituted for political identification after the Euromaidan, which further confuses ordinary residents. In our mass media, one can see such headlines: ""Ukrainians stood up against Moscow popes."" It is about the attack of nationalists on Ukrainian Orthodox believers, most of whom are also Ukrainians. The so-called ""anti-Ukrainian"" position often consists in criticizing the current government. At the same time, Western mercenaries can be declared ""honorary Ukrainians,"" and pacifist ethnic Ukrainians unwilling to take up arms can be declared ""anti-Ukrainians.""

At the same time, Ukraine does not give up its claim to the name Rus, which is related to Russia and Belarus; it just considers Kiev rather than Moscow to be the center of Rus, and Ukrainian nationalists consider Russia itself to be the ""wrong"" and ""Asian"" Russia, contrasting it with the ""European"" Russia, i.e., Ukraine.

2. The People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of their independence/secession from Ukraine. You have said on different occasions that the people of these regions wanted autonomy, that they were not ""separatists."" What sort of autonomy did they want, and why did they finally secede?

10 years ago, referendums were held in the regions of Donbass as a result of the Maidan coup in Kiev two months earlier when Viktor Yanukovych, the president of Ukraine, who was originally from Donetsk, was overthrown. In Donbass there was an extremely negative reaction to this coup. Earlier during the Maidan period (2013-2014), there were clashes in Kiev between Maidan and Anti-Maidan participants (the latter were mostly residents of Donbass, Crimea, Odessa, and Kharkiv). This confrontation laid the foundations for further development of the conflict.

This video from March 13, 2014 shows the mass resistance of Donetsk residents against groups of Ukrainian nationalists (among them ultra soccer fans) who came to suppress pro-Soviet sentiments and demolish the Lenin monument in Donetsk, as they had done earlier in Kiev.

Since radical nationalists were the main striking force on the Maidan, it was clear to the residents of south-eastern Ukraine that they would be deprived of some rights due to a coup d'état (their linguistic, cultural, and economic rights).

That is why initially Donbass (short for Donetsk Basin) demanded only autonomy, self-government, the right to decide for themselves what language to speak and which heroes to honor. Rallies for autonomy in Donbass began near monuments to Vladimir Lenin, which nationalists rushed to savagely demolish during the Maidan. The round-the-clock guarding of the Lenin monuments later developed into people's vigilante groups that fought back against the nationalists.

The autonomy of Donbass was prescribed even in the Minsk agreements, which were in force until February 2022. That is, it was assumed that Donbass would return to Ukraine if Ukraine guaranteed its autonomy. However, the Ukrainian authorities were unwilling to do so for two reasons: (1) for Ukrainian nationalists, it was important to finally suppress the movements in Donbass by force in order to avenge the deaths of their nationalist friends; (2) for the West, which financed the new Ukrainian government, it was important to maintain constant tension on the border with the Russian Federation, and preferably a mass exodus of millions of people from Donbass to the Russian Federation to create a social crisis there.

3. In your latest monthly report on the Ukraine conflict, you mentioned that Crimea had an autonomous government since the 1990s, and that the Ukrainian government control was always weak there. We do not hear about these things nowadays. Could you describe what that autonomous governance meant for Crimea, and if that was an important factor for the peninsula to rejoin Russia in March 2014 through a referendum?

Crimea was given to Ukraine by Nikita Khrushchev in 1954 as a sign of friendship between the Ukrainian and Russian people on the 300th anniversary of the signing in 1654 of a treaty on the transfer of part of the territories of present-day Ukraine from the Polish kingdom to the kingdom of Russia (which was the result of a long peasant war and a religious war).

However, the transition to the Ukrainian SSR did not really mean anything for Crimea until 1991. After the collapse of the USSR, Crimea, where the Ukrainian population was always small, held a referendum on the creation of autonomy as a separate part of the USSR. Ukraine (still part of the USSR at the time) recognized its autonomous status. In this status, Crimea soon became part of Ukraine as well.

Until 2014, Ukraine's power was indeed weak on the peninsula. On the other hand, Crimea received practically nothing from the center (Kiev), as a result of which the infrastructure and monuments there gradually fell into disrepair (as well as throughout Ukraine).

After 2014, the secession of Crimea and the Donbass republics, along with the migration of hundreds of thousands of people from other regions, shifted the political balance in Ukraine -- in the remaining part, nationalists and supporters of NATO and the EU could claim at least half of the votes. Nationalists in Ukraine have since repeatedly said that they only want the territories, but not the people living on those territories. This attitude, expressed in the media, only strengthened the resistance of the inhabitants of these regions.

Regional divisions intensified in all former Soviet republics after the collapse of the Soviet Union also as a result of deteriorating living standards and, consequently, increased internal competition.

4. In regards to referendums, the Donetsk and Lugansk Republics joined the Russian Federation through a referendum in September 2022. However, according to residents of the Donbass, who spoke to the press during the vote, this was not the first referendum in the region. If so, when did the previous referendums take place, and what were they about: autonomy or secession?

The first referendum in Donbas was held in 1994 simultaneously with parliamentary elections in Ukraine. The main question was about recognizing Ukraine as a federation, which implied a certain autonomy of the provinces (as in the Russian Federation, Germany, the USA, India, Brazil, etc.).

Residents of Donetsk and Lugansk regions then also spoke in favor of recognizing Russian as a second state language and strengthening economic ties with Russia (Russia was the main buyer of Donbass enterprises' products). The overwhelming majority then favored federation, a second state language, and stronger ties with Russia.

In 2014, two referendums were held -- in Donetsk and Lugansk regions. The referendum included a single question in two languages (Russian and Ukrainian): ""Do you support the act of state self-rule ('samostoyatel'nost') of the Donetsk/Lugansk People's Republic?"". Two options were offered: ""Yes"" and ""No.""

The term ""samostoyatel'nost"" used in the question can imply both full state sovereignty and autonomy/self-rule within a state entity. Russia then recommended postponing the referendum in order not to complicate the situation, but it was held.

The next referendum was held in 2022 and concerned joining the Russian Federation, but exactly as republics (DPR and LPR) -- autonomous republics with all the attributes of republics preserved.

In other words, for the nationalist policy of Ukraine, federalization was equated long ago with ""separatism,"" demands for autonomy were suppressed for the sake of unification of the state, while the Russian Federation respectfully treats autonomies, republics within its composition with their national languages, cultural peculiarities, and economic ties.

The federal structure of Ukraine, with its linguistic and cultural diversity, would prevent Ukraine's sharp turn after the coup toward NATO and the severing of ties with Russia, China, and Iran. Diversity and federal structure just complicate any sharp turn.

Anti-Coup Rebellion in Eastern Ukraine Completes 10 Years as Russian Forces Continue Advancing in Donetsk

5. This year is the 10th anniversary of the Euromaidan coup. How has this ""milestone"" been commemorated in Ukraine -- both by the government and by the people?

In Ukraine, during martial law, all mass meetings are banned because they are considered unsafe. Although radical nationalists periodically organize their marches, they are not touched, as they form the main pillar of the government. But there were no significant events these days. All attention in Ukraine is focused on the events on the front, mass conscription, and pleas to the US and EU to give more money. The events of the Maidan have taken a back seat to this and the criminal cases of the Maidan period are bogged down in years-long legal proceedings.

Ukrainian media and officials try every day to excite the tired population with emotional appeals, hysterical proclamations that ordinary people are more likely to tune out, to stop perceiving the media and forget even about the events of a year ago, not to mention Euromaidan.

However, once Ukrainians manage to escape from their homeland, they usually stop being interested in it. A recent survey, for example, showed that half of the Ukrainians living in Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic are not interested in events in Ukraine and have no plans to ever return there.

To some extent, it can be said that even getting rid of Ukrainian citizenship and ties to the current state of Ukraine has become an obsession for millions of its citizens. This is because the public consensus was forcibly broken in 2014 after the Euromaidan coup. Most Ukrainians wanted to just live, work, and be harassed less by the state. The pro-US concept of the new Ukrainian state (after Euromaidan) is so unsustainable that it requires Ukrainians to constantly sacrifice their lives, health, [and] property but without offering anything in return and instead cutting social payments, closing hospitals, schools, and businesses as part of the neoliberal course.

6. May 2, 2024 completed 10 years of the Odessa Trade Union House massacre. What is the current situation in Odessa, which has a significant Russian population? Is there any pro-autonomy movement in Odessa and in other Russian-majority regions of Ukraine?

Since 2014, many Odessa residents have migrated to the Russian Federation. In Donbass, they even formed the backbone of some armed formations of the republics. In general, people have been leaving Ukraine by the thousands in recent years for various reasons, both political and economic. Now in Odessa, as nowhere else in Ukraine, there is forced conscription -- men are caught on the streets every day and forcibly sent to the front. Thousands of men are fleeing daily through the Odessa region to Moldova and Romania, so there are hundreds of cars abandoned along the border. Ukrainian authorities are now digging ditches along the border and putting up rows of fences with barbed wire to prevent men from fleeing, as there is almost no one left to fight in the country.

Russian and Ukrainian media periodically write about acts of sabotage on the railroads, which they attribute to Odessa partisans, but I cannot confirm this. During the years of repression and far-right terror, any opposition movement in Ukraine, if it exists, has been driven deep underground.

Ukrainian security services also periodically create ""decoys"" -- fake resistance groups that are tasked with identifying disloyal citizens.

On the other hand, now, both in Russia and in the EU, there are millions in diasporas of Ukrainian citizens -- residents of Odessa, Kiev, Kharkiv, Lviv -- former drivers who leave the country for humanitarian supplies and never return, former police officers, defected military personnel, and ordinary farmers. If we do not take into account the elderly, who usually don't like to migrate, there are now more Ukrainians outside Ukraine than inside.

7. What is the situation of the people of Ukraine, how are they living their daily lives? What is the general view towards the government of the country, how much support does Zelensky still have?

Any war always implies the presence of a small group of people who profit from it, from stealing humanitarian supplies, weapons, foreign aid. In this respect, a small part of Ukrainians, close to the elite, has enriched itself considerably. In no country in Europe can you see as many expensive cars in a day as in Kiev. For this category of the population, it is important that the war be eternal.

The population remaining in Ukraine is divided into those who are fighting and relatives of the dead and wounded on one side and those who have not been touched by the war. The authorities are skillfully manipulating, pitting one group against the other. This is presented under the guise of ""justice."" According to the logic that the Ukrainian authorities instill in the population, if one part of the population has suffered, then all others should suffer as well. Such manipulations help them to divert dissatisfaction from themselves and their corruption, in particular.

Naturally, living standards in Ukraine have dropped significantly, although it was already the poorest country in the European continent, competing with neighboring Moldova for this title. Ukrainian internally displaced persons were recently paid $50 a month, but had to pay $40 for light and water in hostels for the displaced. This spring, that $50 was taken away from them as well. The authorities explain away the reduction of payments and the closure of hospitals and schools as military needs. On the other hand, the Ukrainian economy survives solely on external loans from Western countries, which are issued so that Kiev can partially repay previous loans.

Ukrainian men cannot go abroad now, but they cannot get a job legally either (if they do, they are immediately taken into the army). Many people survive thanks to unofficial work.

Attitudes towards Zelensky personally and Ukrainian politicians are difficult to trace, as people are afraid to answer questions. Social services in Ukraine cater exclusively to representatives of the authorities. Recently, for example, a poll by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology showed that the overwhelming majority of Ukrainians are ready to accept an increase in electricity prices even though people already owe billions in electricity bills. This only shows that the polls are bogus. On the streets, people are afraid to discuss political and military issues, and Ukraine's security services intimidate them even more by daily detaining even children who have expressed any kind of negative thoughts about Zelensky or NATO.

8. Why do you think the Zelensky government is attacking civilians not only in the Donbass but also in the Russian border provinces of Belgorod, Kursk, and Bryansk, while the Ukrainian armed forces go on losing on the battlefield?

The target of the entire operation of overthrowing the Ukrainian government in 2014 and the subsequent war with Donbass is not Ukraine, but Russia. It is important for the West to provoke discontent, coup, or social tension inside the Russian Federation. The Ukrainian attacks have been suicidal, but it is not the Ukrainian command that decides where to advance, what to undermine, what to shell. Ukrainian soldiers are acting on the advice of Western instructors.

Ukrainian MPs are even saying that Ukrainian soldiers will later have to participate in other wars on the US side for today's US assistance. Simply put, they will go wherever the Pentagon sends them to suppress rebel movements in the countries of the Global south.

In fact, Ukraine has become a private mercenary company of NATO which exists only to fight against NATO opponents.

9. How much US/NATO influence is felt in Ukraine -- in the war as well as in the economy and the political life of the country?

The Ukrainian economy is ruined, and the country is up to its neck in debt to the IMF and other Western creditors. The country will never be able to pay off these debts. The NATO secretary general recently said that if Ukraine does not win, there will be no point in rebuilding it. Militarily, the country is also completely dependent on arms supplies from NATO countries. Without them, the Ukrainian army would not last. In turn, the Russian Federation also often emphasizes in the media that they are fighting a proxy NATO army, demilitarizing the NATO bloc itself. There are several thousand mercenaries from NATO countries fighting in Ukraine. There are also some mercenaries from Colombia fighting in the neo-Nazi battalion Carpathian Sich.

In addition, the Ukrainian authorities make all economic decisions, from the level of water tariffs to cutting benefits for the wounded, based on the recommendations of the embassies of Western countries (mainly the US and Britain, the other NATO countries have no influence). Ukrainians are told that they are in no position to refuse. Simply put, if the United States gives them a loan, they will pay the salaries of Ukrainian teachers this month; if it does not, they will not give them salaries or advise them to quit.

10. How do you envision the end of the war? Do you think Ukraine would lose more territory, in addition to the four provinces that already became part of Russia since September 2022? Is there a possibility that NATO might get fully involved in the war, and even the ""nuclear option"" may be invoked?

Yes, I suppose Ukraine will lose more territory, though I think it will be preserved as a state with exorbitant foreign debts hanging over it. Putin recently talked about a cordon sanitaire to keep Russian territories safe from shelling and invasions, followed by a new offensive in Kharkov region in May 2024. I do not think NATO as a bloc will dare to go directly against a nuclear-armed country, but perhaps when they run out of Ukrainian troops, more troops from Eastern European countries and other US satellites will be sent to Ukraine. What is at stake for the West, after all, is the preservation of its global hegemony and the ability to dictate terms to the countries of the Global South.

The report breaks down the role of advanced nuclear technology to meet decarbonisation goals and notes that various regions and governments are including the technology in core policy objectives. The report also offers an overview of the trends and challenges that face the nuclear supply chain, spanning from extraction and processing to end-use applications and waste management.

CRA's report, titled: 'Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies: A Tailwind for Nuclear Energy Revival' further says: ""The renewed prominence of nuclear in the energy transition reflects the growing emphasis on energy security and decarbonization among policy makers. Alongside the repowering of existing nuclear plants, advanced nuclear technologies are now also under the spotlight as they hold the promise of shorter construction timelines, lower overhead costs, and cross-industry applications.""

The report highlights that given some of the biggest challenges to infrastructure investing are inflation and regulation, including permitting and licensing, taxation, and safety standards, investors require certainty.

Meera Kotak, Associate Principal at CRA and co-author of the report, points to the recent collapse of Nuscale's Idaho National Laboratory scheme as an example of the challenges advanced reactors face when considering deployment: ""The Nuscale news really does show how difficult it can be for developers to line up all the different components in the macro context of high inflation and high interest rates. If you are a developer that started back when the rates weren't what they are today, you are going to be hit by them even if you're grounded in the best technological positions.""

Kotak points to some relatively simple solutions though: ""In the first instance, the industry needs government support to drive projects forward in the first of a kind development. The industry would also benefit from a coherent regulatory framework that crosses borders.""

Indeed, Kotak tells NEI that alongside sustained policy support, a better regulatory framework is needed for advanced reactors to deliver on their potential: ""The technology can be mature, the customers can be ready and we are seeing a lot of market demand there, but having those government policy and regulatory markers to incentivise investment is still needed. The central mechanisms aren't yet in the place that they need to be to enable the advent and progression of advanced reactors.""

Nonetheless, she does pick up on some positive signs of change: ""There is an element of sharing on the fundamentals across borders. There have been some examples with the US and Canada in terms of exchanging learnings on the regulatory processes that they're undertaking.""

However, Kotak notes that much of the regulatory structure was developed around large conventional reactors that has a knock-on impact on, for example, how insurance products for small reactors are set up and delivered. This in turn has an impact on how the private sector perceives advanced reactors as an attractive investment prospect. ""The regulatory system needs to evolve as the products evolve; investors seem interested in the promise of advanced and small reactors relative to conventional, but it's very much hinged on policy sentiment."" Kotak highlights the Inflation Reduction Act rolled out earlier this year in the US as an example of positive sentiment that could serve as a model for wider advanced reactor deployment: ""The tax credits that we saw in the US with the IRA, has been very promising given the wave of new developments and progress that occurred as a result. Given the nascency of these new technologies, the role of government and the introduction of supportive policy has shown to be important in navigating the uncertainty that comes with innovation.

Kotak also identifies a number of other challenges that must be addressed if advanced reactors are to be deployed at scale. ""Whilst there are nuances across the different technologies, considerations do need to be made with regards to the supply chain, and labour and skills capacity. Public sentiment towards nuclear is also part of the challenge and needs to be overcome, given the benefits, and passive safety features, that small and advanced reactors bring relative to conventional designs.""

Indeed, the report argues that under certain circumstances, the economic viability of advanced nuclear technologies is notable, offering some advantages relative to other energy sources, including renewable and storage portfolios. This distinction is particularly noticeable at high levels of renewable penetration when contributions to capacity from renewables starts to decline.

Kotak adds: ""It's exciting that there are so many different options on the table and each have distinct points that they're working through, but equally opportunities to offset. Whilst there might be a supply chain obstacle for one design, it might also enable it to advance because of other factors that are impeding a different design get solved first.""

Advanced nuclear can also offer a more appealing proposition for off-takers or utility buyers, as demonstrated by the evaluation of the value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE), which considers the relative contribution of the technology to the electricity system in terms of energy, capacity and flexibility services.

The report notes that the case for additional advanced nuclear capacity is reinforced by the fact that long-term operation of nuclear power plants has the lowest levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) among all other technologies, including newly built solar and offshore wind. However, larger reactors often have extended construction timelines and conventional nuclear reactors (Generation I, II and III) typically feature high levels of fuel expenditure, with most of the construction activities occurring at the reactor site. As Kotak says: ""Advanced reactors such as the molten salts, the micro reactors, they're all being predicated on the fact that they're trying to offset the challenges that the large reactors bring for example trying to offset those cost overruns that appear to be inherent with traditional designs. Each has a USP and each of them is trying to target or offset a problem that has been in the industry and that's a positive.

A recently published report on behalf of EPRI and conducted by CRA titled, shows how across 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, a first of a kind (FOAK) small modular reactor (SMR) has an overall average capital cost that is 16% less than a conventional light water reactor (LWR), primarily driven by lower financing costs resulting from shorter construction durations. This could ultimately result in lower total project costs for smaller reactors compared to their larger counterparts when considering both overnight and financing expenses.

Additionally, when integrated with thermal storage, advanced nuclear technologies can provide enhanced flexibility in the delivery of ancillary services, further underscoring their intrinsic advantages compared to conventional alternatives.

The report says that merits of advanced nuclear technologies present a strong case for potential investment opportunities. While external influences, such as government and industry, play a major role in de-risking investment, the role of the investor itself is critical in bridging the investment gap needed to enable the transition towards second-of-a-kind reactors and achieve commercial returns.

""There is an argument to say that it is not which design will win, but which one will be able to be deployed first. There's a variety of market policy and regulatory factors, skills factors, supply chain and fuel factors that must be addressed, but at the end of the day, you need that customer demand and you need the funding to be able to get it not just to first of a kind, but to commercial return, which requires Nth of a kind deployment. This is where the returns that make it economic can be seen. The industry needs enough funding for it to get to not just one, but perhaps four, seven, reactors that enable Nth of a kind projections. At this point, the economic benefits align and compound the otherwise existing inherent benefits of small reactors, such as the ability to power remote locations and offset grid infrastructure problems, and the modular construction and factory build approach that is poised to offset costs,"" she says.

The report highlights a number of examples of policies encouraging private sector engagement, noting for example, that Canada and the US have consistently supported nuclear as part of their energy mix. Both countries have extensive governmental backing for the advancement of nuclear technologies.

Canada's introduction of a clean technology investment tax credit of 30% explicitly focuses on SMR technology. Canada also recognises nuclear energy as a 'fundamental and necessary component' of the low-carbon energy system.

In addition, the development of SMRs is supported at both the national and provincial levels. The federal government released its SMR Roadmap in 2018 and SMR Action plan in 2020, supporting the development, demonstration and deployment of SMRs for various uses domestically and internationally. Canada's federal budget for 2023, announced in March, provided a 15% refundable investment tax credit for clean electricity, including nuclear. This credit is separate from the clean technology investment tax credit introduced in the 2022 federal budget, which provided a tax credit of up to 30% for non-emitting electricity generation technologies, including SMRs. On March 28, 2022, the provinces of Ontario, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and Alberta released a plan outlining a path forward for SMRs as a deliverable under the provincial SMR memorandum of understanding (MoU). Ontario Power Generation (OPG), Bruce Power, New Brunswick Power and SaskPower have been working collectively to develop three streams of SMR project proposals. On September 21, 2023, the province of Alberta announced the allocation of US$5m in funding (C$7m) towards a multi-year research initiative aimed at assessing the techno-economic feasibility, as well as considerations for safety behind implementing SMRs within oil sands operations.

As Kotak says: ""Such policy measures would give confidence to investors that this is a technology that we are going to support and it is not going to be dropped and lose your investment. Similar to what was done with wind and solar. It's only at the price it is today because of that level of support to drive innovation and driving new supply chains. Private investment has come in now because of the amount of subsidies that went into it from the outset.""

The report also emphasises the growing role of the private sector, noting that in July 2023, OPG announced its collaboration with the provincial government to plan and license three additional SMRs, for a total of four SMRs at OPG's Darlington New Nuclear Project.

Earlier in January, OPG, GEH, SNC-Lavalin and Aecon signed the first commercial contract for a grid-scale SMR in North America. The six-year partnership seeks to finalise the construction of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Darlington site by the end of 2028, with plans to commence power supply to the grid in 2029. This comes in the wake of the Canadian Infrastructure Bank commitment of US$713m (C$970), announced in October 2022, to finance the first phase of OPG's Darlington New Nuclear Project. In 2021, OPG selected GEH's BWRX-300 SMR for the project.

Kotak picks up on these developments: ""It's great to see different vendor-utility or customer partnerships that are driving for clusters or multiples of reactor units that still reach the required output.""

The report notes that Europe is also seeing both public and private sector engagement, highlighting that the market is divided in its views on the role of nuclear energy in the future energy mix. Some countries, including Germany, Italy and Lithuania, have phased out nuclear power; Austria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal signed a joint declaration, opposing the inclusion of nuclear in the EU Green finance taxonomy. In contrast, France, the European leader in nuclear power, has brought together a 'Nuclear Alliance' consisting of 11 countries. This alliance will work towards strengthening cooperation in nuclear energy as an important component of Europe's energy goals.

In a bid to cement its leadership in civilian nuclear energy, France, in 2022, announced its plans to build six new next-generation nuclear reactors by 2050, with a possibility of deploying an additional eight. This plan was catalysed by Parliament's recent approval of the Government's nuclear investment plan, allocating €52bn to the construction of new reactors. While the project work is yet to begin, EDF Energy plans to commission its first two facilities in 2035 and a third in 2040. France's ambition to deploy its first SMR by 2030 contributes to the government vision for nuclear to account for more than 50% of the country's electricity mix.

The report further notes that in Poland, energy-intensive companies such as Synthos and PKN Orlen, established a joint venture to deploy an SMR fleet, GEH's BWRX-300. In addition, ENEA Group, one of the largest power companies in Poland, is collaborating with Last Energy to develop SMRs.

Other countries, including UK, Romania and the Czech Republic that have historically been dependent on coal to meet their energy needs, are increasingly turning to advanced nuclear technologies as a means of decarbonising their energy systems.

""We're seeing the private sector engage in Eastern Europe, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, with high-wealth individuals exploring options with small and advanced reactors. Bill Gates' TerraPower has shown what private investment can do to propel a new reactor design,"" says Kotak.

Kotak also points to a broader economic benefit to those nations that do successfully deploy advanced reactor technology: ""Once that first of a kind small reactor is identified and can be commercially developed, there could be significant export potential for a market."" She adds: ""The timeliness, limitations and opportunities of all clean energy resources - nuclear, CCUS, hydrogen, geothermal - need to be considered.""

The report says that the nuclear energy sector challenge is exacerbated by the imminent retirement of the current nuclear workforce. A multi-year, multi-unit build-up of nuclear reactors will require addressing the labour shortage at various stages, including education, recruitment for entry-level positions and the identification of highly skilled master tradespeople.

""From a vendor developer perspective, business models are set up with the intention to build more than one reactor, given the level of infrastructure, supply chain, manufacturing capabilities and people required. The repeatability is the USP. If the modular construction, factory build, and ability to just repeat orders isn't taken up on, it could miss a key opportunity. The report notes that designs are planned for modules to be built at factories and then transported to the main reactor site, reducing the total construction time required. Microreactors take this concept a step further and are designed such that the entire reactor can be transported at once,"" says Kotak.

Nonetheless, Kotak is optimistic, she says: ""Advanced nuclear technology could play a pivotal role in the decarbonisation of our energy systems. I am positive because fundamentally, regardless of what design gets chosen, it has a role to play as a clean energy source, and to enable the pathway to net zero. I think, ultimately, we need to be reminded that all COP nations or signatories have all signed up to this to reduce emissions and to reach those net zero goals."" As Kotak concludes: ""As the costs become more secure, the investment returns become more clear and that regulatory and policy structures are in place to give that confirmation of returns, I think we will see more private investment, as we've seen with other energy sources.""",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.3333333333333333,453699639,20,https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/Double_Unit_2_8K_1440x810.webp,eng-9584248

Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has emphasised the need to diversify resources for social housing development, from the State, the public, society and financial institutions, in order to provide support for both sellers and buyers.

PM Chinh made this call while chairing a meeting with ministries and agencies in Hanoi on May 17 to discuss solutions to social housing development, as part of a project aiming to construct at least 1 million social housing units for low-income earners and industrial zone workers in the 2021-2030 period.

In his remarks, Secretary of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union Central Committee Ngo Van Cuong said the Ho Chi Minh Trail, also called Truong Son Trail, went down in the country's history as a legendary route and a miracle, and became a symbol for educating today's young generation about the revolutionary ideal and the spirit of overcoming challenges.

It also holds practical significance in the current national construction and defence, he noted.

Sixty-five years ago, to carry out the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission's policy on opening a route to deliver support to the revolution in the South, thanks to extraordinary efforts and the determination of reunifying the nation, forces built a strategic transportation route from rudimentary trails along the majestic Truong Son Mountain Range.

The system of arteries served as not only a strategic military transportation and logistics network but also a fierce battlefront, vividly demonstrating the solidarity in combat among Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

As part of the activities commemorating the trail's 65th anniversary, between May 15 and 17, representatives of the former pioneering youths and youth union members held a programme in the provinces to express gratitude to the war veterans and former pioneering youths who once performed duties along the legendary trail./.

Da Nang's health care service to go digital

The central city has approved the 'smart' health care development project in 2025-30, promising all hospitals and health care centres we go digital in procedures, examinations and treatments.

The city said the project will be receiving total fund of VNĐ488.95 billion (US$19.56 million) for building data and infrastructure.

By 2025, all hospitals and health centres will be using digital medical records and cashless payment, offering online medical check-ups and examinations and medical consultancy or using database of patients and national database-connected ID cards.

The 'smart' health system will provide facilities for doctors giving medical consultancy to patients with online medical examination and treatment.

It also includes global positioning system (GPS) tracking of ambulances for doctors providing first aid instructions on the way to hospital.

Deputy director of the city's health department Võ Thu Tùng said the city's health data will be connected with the national health data centre, supporting doctors with patient's medical records nationwide.

The 'smart' health care system would start using AI Robot in treatment and examination in 2030 as well as medical training, he said.

Tùng said doctors will use digital images or online photos instead of checking films in examination of patients.

Last year, the city put into operation the first Intelligent Operation Centre (IOC), starting the first service of the 'smart' city plan, allowing local people and businesses to apply for paperwork from home via the city's online public one-stop service.

The system has helped speed up the procedure schedule, saving $44.2 million and cutting 20 per cent of other costs in manpower payment.

A total fund of VNĐ2.14 trillion ($95 million) has been allocated for the 'smart' city plan in 2030-45, in which information technology and communication will play a key role in the digitalisation process.

The central hub has targeted becoming the first in Việt Nam to join the ASEAN 'smart' city network by 2030.

A report from the city's information and communication department said 16 health centres and hospitals have been using digital records

Đà Nẵng, in co-operation with the military-owned telecommunications group Viettel, and FPT Group have been jointly developing a 5G network, an Internet of Things (IoT) service, a digital database centre, cyber security services and digital transforming.

Việt Nam-Denmark cooperate for a sustainable agriculture

The Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Jacob Jensen, is leading a high-level delegation to visit Việt Nam on 14-16 May 2024.

Together with a group of Danish agri-food companies with advanced technology and know-how on sustainability and green transition, the aim of the minister's visit is to intensify high-level policy dialogue with Vietnamese counterparts with a focus on a more sustainable food production and a resource efficient supply chain.

Việt Nam and Denmark have developed a close and long- term bilateral relation on food safety. Since 2017, the bilateral cooperation has concentrated on facilitating co-operation within feed and food safety. The co-operation is a crucial part of the Green Strategic Partnership launched by the two Prime Ministers last November, where the two countries have committed to promote green transition and green growth, supporting Việt Nam in building a green economy and fulfilling the country's commitment to achieve net-zero emission by 2050.

The SSC Food programme between Việt Nam and Denmark has been implemented by the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) and the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD). The first phase of the programme focused on improving framework conditions for animal feed production through capacity development of government officials and on the legislative framework for prudent use of veterinary drugs. In phase 2, which ran from April 2020 to April 2024, the main themes of cooperation are enhancing capacity across various stages of the food chain from farm to fork, combating anti-microbial resistance (AMR), feed control and traceability and recall of unsafe food.

During his visit, Minister Jensen has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Vietnamese Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) Lê Minh Hoan extending the government-to-government co-operation. For the coming years, the co-operation will have increased focus on the green transition of food and agricultural production, aiming to promote a more sustainable and resilient food system.

Jensen said: ""Denmark's green transition in sustainable food production has led to the development of strong, innovative methods and approaches throughout the value chain, which boost production yield and improve product quality but at the same time consume less water and energy.

""We look forward to sharing these insights and inspire further collaboration with our Vietnamese partners. Our agreement is a strong testament to our fruitful cooperation where the two ministries do not only share common needs and interests but more importantly a common goal and vision: a sustainable and resilient food system.""

During his visit, the Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries also made a keynote speech at a workshop on Antimicrobial Resistance in agriculture and aquaculture. Antimicrobial resistance is a big threat to public health and human health nowadays. Therefore, this has been an important track of the Strategic Sector Co-operation Food programme.

The minister's visit to Việt Nam this time, the second Danish high-level visit within just two months, has been also accompanied by a group of Danish companies and producers who own world leading's solutions in food production and processing, storages, optimising the use of food and agriculture resources, drainage and water techniques.

Việt Nam is an attractive destination for Danish businesses in the agricultural sector. At present, Denmark has been one of the EU countries with the highest export per capita to Việt Nam and the agri-food sector constitutes approximately half of the total Danish exports to Việt Nam.

""Việt Nam has become an important and attractive market for Danish businesses and investors,"" Jensen said.

""Although Việt Nam and Denmark are geographically very far from each other, we are facing many of the same challenges and we have to continue working together to find ways to use resources effectively. In a smart way to increase competitiveness and sustainability.""

During his visit in the South of Việt Nam, the minister will visit Food Bank Vietnam, an important partner for the efforts to combat food waste and food loss. He will also pay site visits to a catfish aqua-farm in Tiền Giang and an aqua-feed factory in Bến Tre, where close partnerships between Vietnamese and Danish research institutions and companies promotes the use of new green technologies and solutions for a sustainable aquaculture production in Việt Nam.

On his last day of the visit, he will deliver a keynote speech at the seminar on ""Sustainable agri-food production - Danish innovative technologies and financing opportunities"". The seminar will provide a forum to connect and facilitate exchange of experiences, technologies, financing and business opportunities between authorities, local decision-makers, sector managers as well as Danish and Vietnamese entrepreneurs.

Basket, brocade weaving of S'tiêng people recognised as National Intangible Cultural Heritage

Basket weaving and brocade weaving of the S'tiêng people has been included in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism in 2023 and 2024.

Bình Phước Province Department of Culture, Sports, and Tourism on May 15 held a ceremony at Bù Gia Mập National Park to announce the inclusion of the traditional crafts of basket weaving and brocade weaving of the S'tiêng people in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

Bình Phước is known as a region where many ethnic groups live together. Among them, the S'tiêng people are the second-largest ethnic group in the province, with nearly 97,000 people residing in 11 districts, towns, and cities of the province.

With this population size and long history, the S'tiêng community has created its own unique and distinctive cultural identity, including the traditional crafts of basket weaving and brocade weaving.

The basket weaving and brocade weaving crafts of the S'tiêng people are traditional crafts accumulated and developed over many generations, demonstrating the skill and creativity of S'tiêng artisans.

To create baskets and brocade products, the artisans must have talent, skills, and a thorough understanding of techniques.

Additionally, they must know how to identify and properly exploit natural materials such as tree leaves and bark to create dyeing materials and weaving patterns.

These techniques and knowledge reflect the accumulation, creativity, and refinement over time to produce unique products of the S'tiêng people in Bình Phước Province.

At the announcement ceremony, Nguyễn Khắc Vĩnh, deputy director of the Department of Culture, Sports, and Tourism of Bình Phước Province, said that the inclusion of the basket weaving and brocade weaving crafts of the S'tiêng people in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list not only honours the historical and cultural values of these traditional crafts but also recognises the efforts of local authorities and the dedication of the S'tiêng artisans and community in preserving and promoting the value of these crafts.

Vĩnh suggested that relevant authorities should continue protecting and promoting the intangible cultural heritage value of basket weaving and brocade weaving.

The provincial museum should continue researching and collecting more information to clarify the value and significance of these crafts, providing documentation and guidance to local communities, which are the heritage bearers, to effectively preserve and promote the cultural heritage.

Localities should promote traditional craft training, improve skills, create high-quality products rich in cultural identity, prioritise access to funding for households maintaining the craft to expand and develop production.

Policies should encourage and support skilled basket weavers and brocade weavers, establish craft villages as community tourism sites and form basket weaving and brocade weaving cooperatives to promote and introduce products to a broader audience of tourists.

A sheriff's deputy shot Fortson six times, killing the 23-year-old airman while trying to respond to a domestic dispute in a neighboring apartment. Law enforcement is being criticized for entering the wrong apartment and shooting a person who, by virtue of serving in the armed forces, legally possessed his weapon. The Rev. Jamal Bryant eulogized the beloved airman, comparing him to another famous slain civil rights leader, Medgar Evers, who had been a decorated U.S. Army veteran before being gunned down in 1963.

Bryant said, ""... Regrettably, sometimes the skin you wear is more of a magnet to opposition than the uniform that you bear. Because in America, before people see you as a veteran, as an airman in the United States Air Force, they'll see you as a Black man.""

Speaking in an interview with Interfax-Ukraine about Taiwan's participation in three joint projects with the Czech government, Kopečný said: ""Taiwan's participation in these projects is unique. It was Taiwan's initiative when, a year and a half ago, this government quickly and spontaneously contacted the governments of the Czech Republic, Lithuania, and Poland, stating that they wanted to help Ukraine. And we said: yes, of course. We know Ukraine very well, we have relevant experience. This is unique because such projects have never been implemented before. Even though there are no official diplomatic channels between Taipei and Kyiv at present, it is especially important, also for us, that Taiwan is a country that helps the Ukrainian people. And the Ukrainian people will know about it.""

According to Kopečný, the governments of the Czech Republic and Taiwan are implementing three joint projects in the areas of energy supply, drinking water provision, and first medical aid for Ukrainians.

""In the medical field, we are talking about the supply of first aid systems to hospitals in Kharkiv region. This includes several fully modernized and equipped wards with trained doctors in the fields of gynecology, intensive care, pediatrics for children, and surgery. This was done because hospitals are overcrowded with patients suffering from combat injuries, and most doctors, as well as the available capacities, are used for them. The mentioned four areas are primary needs for millions of civilians,"" Kopečný said.

In the field of energy, the Czech Republic and Taiwan are supplying so-called ""co-generators,"" equipment that combines heating and electricity.

""These are large boxes with a generator that combines heating and energy for areas housing 15,000-20,000 people. This equipment is jointly produced by Czech and Taiwanese companies,"" said the government representative. According to him, a total of 10 such units will be delivered to Ukraine.

In the field of water supply, the Czech Republic and Taiwan are providing so-called ""water factories.""

""This is a container system connected to a polluted water source that purifies water to a drinkable level for the population. After the dam in Nova Kakhovka was destroyed, more than 1 million people in Dnipropetrovsk region alone faced a shortage of drinking water. Across Ukraine, according to UN estimates, there are between 5 million and 6 million people who lack regular access to drinking water. This is a really big problem,"" he said.

According to Kopečný, this equipment is mobile and can be easily installed on-site. A total of 13 units of this equipment will be delivered to Ukraine, with each capable of providing water for about 10,000 people. ""We are doing this in coordination with local authorities,"" added the Czech government representative.

He also said that the projects in the fields of energy and water, initiated last year, are designed for a year and will conclude in the upcoming June, while the medical project is planned for three years.

Kopečný expressed hope that the cooperation between the Czech Republic and Taiwan ""will continue, and the people of Taiwan and its government will see the benefits of such participation,"" including in the process of reconstruction and recovery of Ukraine.

""Such assistance makes Taiwan more visible on the international stage. They see that Ukraine is a place where events are happening that can also determine their fate. Ukraine has been experiencing aggression for many years, and at the same time, there are increasingly strong statements from Beijing about the reunification of Taiwan with China. Taiwan is a partner that cares about peace, and the world should care about Taiwan,"" said the Czech government representative.",en.interfax.com.ua,news,Interfax-Ukraine,,0.1764705882352942,453656811,20,https://media.interfax.com.ua/media/thumbs/images/2024/05/1U7t-_aKYtOF.jpg,eng-9576716

Amsterdam - 17 May 2024 - Photon Energy N.V. (WSE: PEN, ""Photon Energy Group"", the ""Group"" or the ""Company"") announces financial results for the first quarter of 2024.

""The first quarter of 2024 was marked by our continued efforts to make our business model more resilient to further economic and geopolitical fluctuations. First of all, we have managed to complete the rebalancing of our IPP portfolio which, as of 1 April 2024, represents a nearly 50/50 split between the support scheme mechanism, or FIT, and a merchant model, selling on day-ahead spot prices. Transitioning to a more balanced portfolio between the two schemes is a strategic move, especially given the declining energy prices in the CEE region and current geopolitical uncertainties. In May 2024, we finally signed a project refinancing agreement for EUR 15 million with EBRD. This funding will undoubtedly provide a significant boost to the Group's expansion plans in Romania and the development of the capacity market offerings. Looking ahead, we believe that the achievements of this first quarter will not be undermined as they help us to leverage the strength of our business model and recover the overall growth and profitability of the Group in 2024. With the above changes in place, we feel more confident that we can promise a more positive trajectory for our Group's business in the coming quarters,"" said Georg Hotar, CEO of Photon Energy Group.

First Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights

In the first quarter, Photon Energy Group's consolidated revenues amounted to EUR 17.375 million, compared to EUR 19.280 million a year earlier, marking a decrease of 9.9% YoY.

Revenues from electricity generation reached EUR 3.746 million, a contraction of 9.7% YoY, primarily due to lower average realized electricity prices, which declined by 23.1% YoY, from EUR 173 / MWh in Q1 2023 to EUR 133 / MWh in Q1 2024. Although electricity generation increased to 30.2 GWh, up by 24.2% YoY, it was still insufficient to offset the impact of falling electricity prices.

Other revenues of the Group also decreased from EUR 15.129 million in Q1 2023 to EUR 13.629 million in the reporting period, down by 9.9% YoY, mainly due to weaker trading volumes of PV components. Other segments performed better than a year ago, particularly Photon Energy's New Energy division, which saw its external revenues increase by 120.5% YoY.

The Group's consolidated EBITDA of EUR 0.783 million more than doubled YoY, compared to EUR 0.330 million in Q1 2023. EBIT improved slightly to EUR -1.425 million, compared to EUR -1.569 million a year earlier. The Group's operating profitability was negatively impacted by the contraction of margins in the energy generation segment, lower volumes of PV component trading, higher personnel costs, and other expenses.

Depreciation increased to EUR 2.113 million from EUR 1.952 million a year earlier, attributable to the addition of new power plants in Romania. Interest expenses rose by 8.5% YoY, totaling EUR 2.678 million. The Group recorded a net loss of EUR -1.321 million, compared to a loss of EUR -4.170 million in Q1 2023. Other comprehensive income amounted to EUR 0.213 million, negatively impacted by foreign currency translation losses. Total comprehensive income for the first quarter of 2024 amounted to EUR -1.108 million.

The Company has published the full-year 2024 guidance, expecting revenues within the range of EUR 90-100 million, up by at least 27% compared to the last year, and EBITDA within the range of EUR 16-18 million, more then triple compared to EUR 3.7 million in 2023.

The Company is organising a video conference on Friday, 17 May at 11:00 a.m., during which it will present its results for the first quarter and answer questions. Participants are asked to send questions during the session via the chat function or in advance via email to ir@photonenergy.com.

Interest expenses rose by 8.5% YoY, totaling EUR 2.678 million. The Group recorded a net loss of EUR -1.321 million, compared to a loss of EUR -4.170 million in Q1 2023. Other comprehensive income amounted to EUR 0.213 million, negatively impacted by foreign currency translation losses. Total comprehensive income for the first quarter of 2024 amounted to EUR -1.108 million.

The Company has published the full-year 2024 guidance, expecting revenues within the range of EUR 90-100 million, up by at least 27% compared to the last year, and EBITDA within the range of EUR 16-18 million, more then triple compared to EUR 3.7 million in 2023.

The Company is organising a video conference on Friday, 17 May at 11:00 a.m., during which it will present its results for the first quarter and answer questions. Participants are asked to send questions during the session via the chat function or in advance via email to ir@photonenergy.com.

(WSE: PEN, ""Photon Energy Group"", the ""Group"" or the ""Company"") announces financial results for the first quarter of 2024.

""The first quarter of 2024 was marked by our continued efforts to make our business model more resilient to further economic and geopolitical fluctuations. First of all, we have managed to complete the rebalancing of our IPP portfolio which, as of 1 April 2024, represents a nearly 50/50 split between the support scheme mechanism, or FIT, and a merchant model, selling on day-ahead spot prices. Transitioning to a more balanced portfolio between the two schemes is a strategic move, especially given the declining energy prices in the CEE region and current geopolitical uncertainties. In May 2024, we finally signed a project refinancing agreement for EUR 15 million with EBRD. This funding will undoubtedly provide a significant boost to the Group's expansion plans in Romania and the development of the capacity market offerings. Looking ahead, we believe that the achievements of this first quarter will not be undermined as they help us to leverage the strength of our business model and recover the overall growth and profitability of the Group in 2024. With the above changes in place, we feel more confident that we can promise a more positive trajectory for our Group's business in the coming quarters,"" said Georg Hotar, CEO of Photon Energy Group.

In the first quarter, Photon Energy Group's consolidated revenues amounted to EUR 17.375 million, compared to EUR 19.280 million a year earlier, marking a decrease of 9.9% YoY.

Revenues from electricity generation reached EUR 3.746 million, a contraction of 9.7% YoY, primarily due to lower average realized electricity prices, which declined by 23.1% YoY, from EUR 173 / MWh in Q1 2023 to EUR 133 / MWh in Q1 2024. Although electricity generation increased to 30.2 GWh, up by 24.2% YoY, it was still insufficient to offset the impact of falling electricity prices.

Other revenues of the Group also decreased from EUR 15.129 million in Q1 2023 to EUR 13.629 million in the reporting period, down by 9.9% YoY, mainly due to weaker trading volumes of PV components. Other segments performed better than a year ago, particularly Photon Energy's New Energy division, which saw its external revenues increase by 120.5% YoY.

The Group's consolidated EBITDA of EUR 0.783 million more than doubled YoY, compared to EUR 0.330 million in Q1 2023. EBIT improved slightly to EUR -1.425 million, compared to EUR -1.569 million a year earlier. The Group's operating profitability was negatively impacted by the contraction of margins in the energy generation segment, lower volumes of PV component trading, higher personnel costs, and other expenses.

Depreciation increased to EUR 2.113 million from EUR 1.952 million a year earlier, attributable to the addition of new power plants in Romania. Interest expenses rose by 8.5% YoY, totaling EUR 2.678 million. The Group recorded a net loss of EUR -1.321 million, compared to a loss of EUR -4.170 million in Q1 2023.

Twenty years after Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the EU, their electricity grids remain synchronised with Russian and Belarusian grids, which means that electricity in all the countries has the matching frequency and can readily flow across borders.

The Baltic states have long planned to instead synchronise their power systems with the EU's grid, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made this an even more pressing issue.

""Grids are the heart of our energy system, and have big geopolitical and strategic importance. This has been underlined by Russia's devastating attacks against Ukraine's energy sector,"" the Estonian EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson told Euractiv.

Simson also said that ""Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania will become fully integrated into the EU's internal electricity market and gain full control of their electricity networks. This will increase the energy security of the whole region"".

The three Baltic countries agreed to set ""early 2025"" as the deadline for synchronisation with Europe's continental grid.

The European Union has invested more than €1.2 billion in subsidies for the project.

""Synchronisation is the most monumental energy independence project in the Baltic States and it is in its final phase,"" the Latvian electricity transmission system operator, JSC 'Augstsprieguma tīkls' (AST) told Euractiv.

The Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian electricity systems were integrated into the IPS/UPS transmission network during the Soviet occupation. This network, which is largely managed by Moscow, supplies 280 million customers with electricity, mainly in the former USSR countries and Central Asia.

In 2007, the then prime ministers of the three Baltic states agreed a strategic objective of joining the European continental grid. On 20 June 2019, these three countries and the European Commission signed a political roadmap to achieve synchronisation.

Riga, Tallinn, and Vilnius have put an end to their electrical isolation by building new interconnecting transmission wires with Finland, Poland, and Sweden. However, their electricity networks remain synchronised with the Russian and Belarusian systems (commonly known as the 'BRELL ring').

In contrast, the EU countries of Central and Eastern Europe - Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, which had all also been part of the Soviet bloc until 1991 - already synchronised their systems with the continental European grid (CEN) between 1995 and 2004.

Synchronisation with the EU grid is planned via the existing transmission line between Lithuania and Poland (LitPol Link) and a future submarine cable between the two countries. Technical equipment must also be deployed, to guarantee the overall stability and security of the electricity system.

Latvian electricity transmission network operator AST told Euractiv the project is 'in the final phase of work', with the installation this month of three 'synchronous condensers' in each of the Baltic countries and the reconstruction by June of the two interconnections between Latvia and Estonia.

In July 2022 Lithuania's Vice-Minister of Energy Albinas Zananavičius announced the country's intention to speed up the transition process and leave the BRELL transmission system before 2025.

Vilnius successfully conducted an isolated operation test of the country's electricity system in April 2023, proving they are capable of joining the synchronous network of continental Europe (UCTE) as early as this year.

However, Estonia and Latvia require more time, and Lithuanian authorities have agreed to wait until all three countries are ready before achieving full synchronisation with the European grid.

In March 2022, the Ukrainian and Moldovan grids were synchronised with the European power system. While the 'emergency synchronisation' could be completed rapidly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the move was based on preparatory technical work which began in 2017.",euractiv.com,news,EurActiv.com,,0.1215686274509804,453528107,36,https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/shutterstock_1434482111-1-800x450.jpg,eng-9576905

Full transcript - EON SE (OTC: EONGY ) Q1 2024:

Iris Eveleigh: Hello, everyone. Dear analysts and investors, welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm here with Marc Spieker, for whom this will be the last earnings call as CFO before he takes over his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Commercial. Marc, thank you very much for our successful earnings calls together. At the same time, I'm excited to have Nadia taking over as CFO in June, and I'm looking forward to having her join the earnings calls from our H1 results onwards. As for today's call, as usual, we will leave enough room for your questions after the presentation. With that, over to you, Marc.

Marc Spieker: Thank you, Iris, and a warm welcome from my side as well. I will save my goodbye words for later. Let us straight dive into the Q1 results, and let me start with highlighting the key messages for today. First message, Q1 came out in line with our expectations for all businesses. Key drivers of our slight EBITDA and net income increase, we're investing back earnings growth and strong operational execution more than offsetting the unwind of prior year one-off and timing effects. Second message. Our planned CapEx ramp-up is progressing well. We have accelerated again our spending by almost 25% year-over-year and are well on track in terms of quarterly fill rates across all business segments. Third message, our Q1 economic net debt came in as expected, showing the typical Q1 cash flow seasonality and the final outflows related to the unwinding of the positive one-off working capital effects that we have been reporting to you as of our 2022 results, and I'll come back to that later. Fourth and final message, we have a strong conviction in the relevant and long-term growth path of our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. To make our ambitions more visible, we are moving the business into a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards as announced. Finally, our guidance is fully confirmed. On to our Q1 EBITDA development. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at EUR 2.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year despite the lack of significant positive impacts from one-offs that we had seen in the prior year quarter. As expected, our Energy Networks business is slightly down in Q1 due to unwinding positive regulatory account effects of 2023, such as the benefit from lower redispatch costs, as well as slightly higher-than-expected costs from upstream networks in Germany. Additionally, we have changed the accounting for our Slovakian VSE business, to an equity consolidation, which leads to a technical reduction in EBITDA in our Central Eastern Europe business, no impact on net income. All those effects are economically neutral and they were largely offset by strong RAB driven earnings growth across all regions and the positive uplift of regulatory parameters in Sweden. Regarding network losses, Sweden and Slovakia have now completed their recoveries, while additional recoveries are now only happening in Southern Eastern Europe. You may have noted that we have now split our reporting of the CEE and Turkey segment into Central Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. This shall give you more transparency on our geographically well-diversified portfolio of networks businesses. The Central Eastern Europe segment covers Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Southeastern Europe segment includes our activities in Hungary, Romania and Turkey. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. New project commissioning is leading to EBITDA growth, as you would expect, supporting our 13% EBITDA accumulated average growth rate target from 2023 to 2028. This development is masked in Q1 by the absence of a positive one-off effect from last year and by changed intra-year maintenance schedule with a stronger focus on Q1 this year. With a change in maintenance schedule, we are partly mitigating also the negative effects from mild weather that we have been observing during the first quarter. In Energy Retail, the significant year-over-year EBITDA increase was primarily driven by positive price adjustments since Q1 last year. Additionally, we benefited from the improvement in our B2B segment in the U.K., which is successfully continuing its margin over volume strategy. Those positive effects were partially offset by the lack of procurement optimization benefits that we had seen in Q1 last year and it's a very favorable commodity price background last year and lower weather-driven volumes in Q1. Corporate Functions and Other segments saw an expected slight EBITDA decline driven by the lower results from our Turkish generation business due to the development of commodity prices also in Turkey. Moving on to our adjusted net income, which showed an increase of 2% which broadly follows the year-over-year EBITDA development. All earnings elements below EBITDA have developed in line with our expectations. The share of minority income sits at around 19% for the first quarter, as expected. And with that, materially below prior year. We expect this share to continue to go down and be lower for the full year as we communicated in our full year 2023 earnings release. Looking at the development of our economic net debt, I would like to highlight 3 points. First, our promised CapEx ramp-up is being executed like clockwork. We increased our Q1 investment spending by close to 25% year-over-year. I can assure you that we continue to be fully focused on ensuring a frictionless ramp up, managing closely our operations and supply chains. So far, we do not see any critical bottleneck on the horizon. Second, we have seen the typical operating cash outflow in Q1, which is driven by our seasonal business patterns in both Energy Retail and Energy Networks, specifically Energy Networks in Germany. As expected, this outflow was slightly amplified by the final unwind of our 2022 one-off working capital benefits. It's a long time ago, not everyone may remember, but our 2022 full year cash conversion set at a very benign 151%, significantly above the 100% we normally target. And as communicated in March for 2024, we are foreseeing a conversion rate of around 90%. And with that, the final reversal of these positive working capital effects from 2022 after 2024, we expect cash conversion to then swing back to the guided 100%. Third message on END, our strong balance sheet position has recently been confirmed by 2 of our rating agencies. We have received a rating upgrade by Standard & Poor's and a full rating confirmation by Moody's (NYSE: MCO ). As communicated before, in line with our commitment to a strong BBB BAA rating, we have additional balance sheet capacity to fund further investments needed for a successful European energy transition if regulatory conditions further improve. Considering the balance sheet, it is also worth highlighting that we have already issued EUR 3.3 billion of bonds in the first quarter. With that, we have already fully covered our funding needs for 2024 and partially already prefunded 2025. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. As announced, we will report this business as a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards. Strategically and with a view to future growth, this segment is all about exploiting the huge business opportunities from decarbonization and to a large extent, electrification of the heating sector. The segment comprises our activities in designing, building, owning, operating and optimizing sustainable energy infrastructure assets for cities and business customers. Our solutions are based on modular standard building blocks, which are configured and digitally connected to fit specific customer needs. Technologically, our offerings include firstly, renewable on and offsite generation assets like photovoltaic and wind. Secondly, gas or biomass-fired heat and power engines. Thirdly, heat pumps and geothermal solutions. Fourthly, waste heat recovery technologies. And finally, high- and low-temperature heating and cooling grids. From a business point of view, we distinguish 2 clusters within Energy Infrastructure Solutions. First cluster is district heating and cooling, which is about running low-carbon heating and cooling networks in urban areas. Second business area is our industrial and commercial solutions business, offering on-site energy infrastructure for industrial and commercial customers. We have decided to also include our U.K. smart metering business in this segment, while technologically, obviously different in nature, it is a quasi-regulated business and hence, of similar nature when it comes to financial visibility and resilience. Let me remind you of some more financial and business characteristics relevant for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. Geographically, we are present in 15 countries, the key ones being Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Our pan-European coverage and strong regional anchoring represent a unique advantage to address our customers' needs for locally optimized energy infrastructure. Our strategy to standardize our offerings in a modular way will allow us to scale our solutions. Therefore, out of the EUR 5 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 years, 80% will be dedicated to growth investments. Through long-term contracts with customers, commodity price volatility and inflation are effectively passed through, for instance, via price escalation clauses. We ensure that any new project is targeted to deliver an internal rate of return spread over WACC of between 120 to 350 basis points. Furthermore, our rigorous focus on operational excellence ensures high asset availability. This is supported by digitalization, which helps to steer, monitor and effectively maintain and optimize the fleet of more than 6,000 assets. We expect annual EBITDA growth of 13% on average. Keep in mind that the municipal heat transition across Europe is still at an early stage. So there is more -- much more to come, but too soon for us to quantify what the impact will be over time. Let me close today's presentation with Slide 8 what you essentially should take away from us today. First, extremely solid Q1 outturn supports our expected earnings delivery for 2024. Second, our investment ramp-up is progressing well, which fully underpins the delivery of our midterm organic growth targets. Third, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We will continue to focus on delivering an attractive total shareholder return based on value creative organic growth and an annually growing dividend per share. And with that, let me move to a personal note. We announced in March that I would be moving on to take over as a Chief Operating Officer, the responsibility for our Energy Infrastructure and Retail Businesses from June onwards this year. We deliver what we promised. So inevitably, today is my last results call as CFO. It has been close to 8 years as CFO in the Board of Management of E.ON, hundreds of roadshows and exactly 30 results calls. I am not going away, but I will be focused on different things going forward. Great news for you is our investors and analysts that with Nadia Jakobi, I have the best successor I can think of. I know that with her, you, your interest and most importantly, your investments will continue to be in safe hands. Dear Iris, I would also like to express my thanks to the best Investor Relations team I can think of. And finally, it has been a privilege for me to represent our company in the capital markets. I'm extremely grateful for so many deep and thoughtful conversations during roadshows and other formats. And a big thank you to all of you for that. Before we get too sentimental, there is still business to be done. So let's move on to our Q&A session.

A - Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, we will start our Q&A session. Let me remind you all briefly, as you all do know, please stick to 2 questions each so that most of you have the chance to ask the questions. If there's anything we can't answer today, then the IR team is always there to also answer further questions from you. With that, the first question comes from Alberto from Goldman Sachs.

Alberto Gandolfi: Good morning, and Marc, thanks for all the help and all the best. We -- I guess we need to lean on you even more on the execution of all these EUR 20 billion CapEx plan. So congratulations, and thank you once more. Two questions on my side. The first one is a border line very boring, but can I understand, please, in the first quarter, what type of nonrecurring items we have in networks and in customer solutions. I'm trying to go to the underlying earnings power. So as I understand, you released some provisions. The weather was very mild, can you tell us if you booked negative and positive network losses, either recovery or cost? That is the first question. I have the feeling the underlying is stronger. That's why I'm asking. The second question is I've seen a DSO plan that implies that potentially if feasible, which I understand from what you're saying is not, your CapEx plan could be 50% higher than what you presented in March. What underpins the plus 50%. Is it possible you give us a view on what assumptions we would have to flex to have even more investments. Is this driven by power demand, electrification, more renewables, data centers or just to have a fee for written.

Marc Spieker: Yes. So Alberto, let me start with the nonrecurring items. Compared to last year, we had a lot of positive one-offs. In Q1 this year is much less impacted by any one-off effect. If you look at our Energy Networks business, I think the remaining piece that we see here is a mid-double-digit million euro amount of final recovery for network losses essentially relating to 2022. So there's still a minor positive one-off in our Energy Networks business. For Energy Retail, essentially, we talk about weather impact, which you may now call kind of extraordinary one-off or not. It's basically a -- it's a metric risk, which will hit us every year kind of in a positive or negative way in Q1 due to the mild temperatures, actually record mild temperatures. That was the second warmest Q1, I think, during the last 50 years. Not that I recollect that, but what the statistics tell and that was a mid-double-digit million euro negative impact. So across both segments, then it's a wash net nil impact from one-off essentially. Your question to CapEx spend there is very valid. And with that, you're referring to a publication that we have also done about the initial allocation plan, which is kind of an exercise, which is regularly done by the DSO in close alignment with the German regulator, where basically, on a regular basis, we look at what are actually the political targets for renewables build or for development of the energy system. Germany specifically relevant Easter package, and then it's broken down in a technical way. So what are, if you implement those targets as they are written, what would technically have to be done in order then to allow for these targets to be executed. And in that sense, this 50% upside to which you referred to, is to be taken with special care. First of all, it just reconfirms what we have been telling our shareholders also with our full year results that when it comes to our network growth plans, there is room for more if economic conditions are right. And this is what we are working on in that sense, there is no change to our communication in our plans that we will continue to be working with the relevant authorities to make sure that economic incentives are the right ones to support this, which is one of the constraints by the way, which this initial allocation plan does not include, but which by legislation is actually given. Secondly, it is a technical plan, which does not take into account practical constraints. And we have seen these practical constraints, particularly playing a role when it comes to permitting, just to mention one, and it would be unrealistic in our view to now assume that they're technically possible in an unconstrained way can be delivered with all the constraints which we have in a practical way. And in that sense, what you should take away is there is a huge potential for E.ON to further invest and accelerate our investments over time. And as just similar to our results, we also have the financial means to do this if the conditions set by the regulators fit.

Alberto Gandolfi: This is very clear. So if you just allow me a comment. You've done essentially if it's clean for Q1, you've done 36% of the midpoint of your guidance in Q1. So it seems you're leaving an easy rest of the year to Nadia from here.

Marc Spieker: I take this as a statement, which I'm not commenting on. We move on.

Iris Eveleigh: Exactly. So we move on to the next question. Thank you, Alberto. Next question comes from Harry from Exane.

Harry Peter Wyburd: So 2 for me. First, can I dig in a little bit to what's going on in U.K. B2B supply. Why is it that you're earning so much, you made so much in such a short period of time? Do you think this is an industry-wide phenomenon for the whole of the U.K. supply market? Or is it just something that you're doing as E.ON? And can you just help us understand a bit what size of clients are driving this very good performance. Are we talking about much smaller B2B customers or medium-sized, just a bit of color there would be very helpful. And second one is a bit more strategic and a bit of a follow-on from Alberto's questions on the CapEx. Is there any update or view from you on what your partners are doing or what others are doing in the German DNO market in terms of funding. Because I guess, if we're talking about an already upgraded CapEx plan potentially seeing even much more significant, more upside? And how are your partners going to fund this? And might we get into a situation where you're effectively incentivized to put your investment into your fully-owned DNO subsidiaries and not the ones where you've got partners because, of course, if your partners aren't putting capital in, it's harder for you to make a good return on your investment.

Marc Spieker: Just on the second one, when you are referring to partner, could you just specify what partners exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to our co-investors on some of the DSO or are you referring to the [indiscernible]? Okay. Good. So let me start with the second question. We see across the board an extremely strong alignment between our interest and the interest of our core investors on a DSO level, which are larger municipalities for a number of our German DSOs and there is a very strong focus on all of our sites to make the energy transition work. And if -- also from a funding point of view to make whatever is there needed and possible also then on the level of the DSO side. And generally, we do not see a particularly constraint on that side or a clash of interest nonesoever. On the I&C business in the U.K., it follows our strategy where we had said that in most markets, we want to exit large B2B customers. So to your question, what are the customers? It's large I&C clients. This is not small, medium enterprises. This is around large industrial and commercial customers. And the U.K. is the only market where we continue to run such a segment at scale. But this is why also strategically, we are very clear on that business, we'll have to be steered on margins and not on volume. So what we have been seeing this business doing is running on a smaller and smaller book and focusing more and more on those customers where we are able then to make a risk-adjusted fair margin if I look at the risk transformation that we're doing for these clients. I don't want to refer and can't refer now to whether that's an industry-wide phenomenon or not. What I can tell you that this is not a one-hit wonder, which has happened now in Q1. It is a development that we have been working for throughout the last 4 years with the continuous effort on managing our customer portfolio in that business.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Deepa from Bernstein.

Deepa Venkateswaran: And Marc, look forward to meeting you in person for your farewell events. So my 2 questions are actually centered around your German networks. So firstly, if I'm not mistaken, you were still awaiting for some more details on the current regulatory period. I was just wondering if you can update if there's been any change on the efficiency factors or anything. And the second one was looking forward to the next regulatory period, there's obviously a consultation out from the regulator to move to back and reduce the regulatory period. And then there's also the live court case that you have for the current period. So just wondering how you think the negotiations will evolve? And should we assume that if you're successful in the court case, the regulator -- I mean is there quid pro quo between getting a better deal post '29 and leaving some money on the table for existing assets now? Or how would you think of this discussion.

Marc Spieker: So where do we have news and where do we essentially looking at the same time line with no -- is expected no further update. So first of all, what we have seen since the full year results is the publication of the efficiency benchmark. And the good news is that E.ON continues to be very efficient, i.e., 100% efficient operator. And I think that underpins our strategic relevance and the efforts that we are doing and continuously focusing on operational excellence also in our Energy Networks business. There hasn't been a further update on then the general efficiency factor. So -- and that stands on the efficiency front. We have now a public confirmation about what we have been working towards any or as an ambition to be fully efficient and we now need to see how the regulator deals with the general efficiency factor. Still, this has not been published yet. On the consultation, then for the regulatory period starting 2028 for I guess '29 for power, no update essentially, Deepa that is worth relevant sharing here. I think what we continue to look at, first and foremost, is the proposal by the regulator. How to deal with depreciation schedules for existing gas networks. So this was one of the ideas expressed as part of the consultation paper where the regulator also pronounced that they were seeking there a fast solution. So kind of in the pipeline to expect is then a clarification by the regulator on how they intend to deal with existing gas networks, which is obviously also relevant for the energy transition in total. And for a lot of the market players, as you know for us gas networks has a very small share in our RAB but this is from a regulatory point of view, what we would expect to be the upcoming release. I think that's on the regulatory side.

Deepa Venkateswaran: Just the court case could you comment.

Marc Spieker: Court case, also no update. So we haven't seen any -- there hasn't been any specific intervention with the court, no hearing, et cetera. So nothing to update on that side.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, we move on to the questions from Wanda from UBS.

Unidentified Analyst: Marc, all the best, again. Two questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, Energy Retail, you had a very strong start into the year. Q1 EBITDA accounts for 50% of the full year guidance. So do you expect any reversal later this year? Or is there any buffer included in the guidance, something similar to what you did at the end of last year. And if there is any buffer, would you be able to quantify it? And the second question is on the UK Retail. In March [indiscernible] launched a discussion paper for the future of price protection, the [indiscernible] collection is upcoming. How do you see the market structure changing as the current one, the price cut doesn't really work.

Marc Spieker: So 2024 guidance, Wanda. I think what I would stress is that we are back basically in normal operations. So while the last 2 years have been very much affected by energy crisis and kind of the relief from the energy crisis. We are now more or less back in normal mode. And I think where we can take confidence from is how well we have managed the first quarter, which has been extremely mild. And this double-digit -- mid double-digit million euro negative impact from weather for the second warmest quarter during the last 50 years. That is a quite good performance. But it's too early now to say at this stage what that means for the remainder of the year. So for our guidance, take that we are managing towards the midpoint as usually. And at this stage, there's nothing that I would flag where we are particularly aggressive or conservative in the way how we have set our guidance. And apart from that, you always know that we deliver what we promise. So -- but the midpoint is what it is at this stage. On U.K. retail, there's not a lot that I would share now in this call except for that what we see is that the U.K. regulator has been much more constructive during the last years reacting to the industry's needs. Think we have also seen this -- of generally seen in Europe, the recognition also of retailers of being a system critical part of the energy value chain. And lastly, what I do see that E.ON specifically is being regarded by politicians and regulators as a company that stands in for the interest of customers and is driving the market to the benefit of the customers. And this gives us also where there are conversations, I think weighted the relevance in being heard in these discussions. And apart from that, it remains what I've said in the past that the U.K. regulation is very little wiggle room now to become worse because if you look at the results, which many of the operators in the U.K. are still achieving, it's not a marketplace where you could now easily just step in as a regulator and believe that U.K. worsening conditions, I think this is still a game about improving conditions to make these operations economically viable.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, next question comes from Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley.

Rob Pulleyn: I have one question, which is quite high level, Marc. And that is, how does E.ON see power demand over time, given, of course, in 2023 it remains significantly lower than we saw precrisis in 2021. Is this structural loss due to industry. What about electrification trends you've spoken about? And also more recently, the data center demand, which we covered on the full year conference call. So I'd love to know what you think is a good suggestion for the medium-term power demand run rate we should be thinking for E.ON from here across the decade.

Marc Spieker: Yes, Rob, it's a very relevant long-term question, but happy to address that. So fundamentally, we are positive about the growth outlook of electricity volumes in our markets. So we expect electricity long term to be on a growth trend. Now when we talk about growth trends in energy, in developed markets, it's never high growth rates, but what we are seeing and expecting is a growth of 1%, 2% annually over time. And with that, of course, electricity will be the key carrier to replace then a number of primary fuels, specifically, you look at transportation, mineral oil , and if you look at heating mineral oil and gas. So growth outlook for electricity long term. And I think that is also important if you allow me that comment. If you look at the impact on affordability of the energy transition and then you should always keep in mind that all of these investments will be spread over time about much more volumes that will be wheeled in the system and increasingly bidirectional. So increasingly, our customers will also provide their power to the system. And so from that end, we are also confident that this will play out in a decent way.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Piotr from Citi.

Piotr Dzieciolowski: I have 2 questions, really. So firstly, I wanted to ask about the B2B business. Is this just the U.K. situation? Or this is also visible -- I know you don't have exposure, but this is also visible in the German and Benelux market? And why you saw [indiscernible] exclude the option to participate if there are some opportunities. You see the tender where the margin would be extremely high, why wouldn't you participate if the situation is similar in the continent? And second question I wanted to ask about your retail customer. Where are we in the process of passing through the lower falling commodity cost to the end customer deals. So if I were a customer in Germany, what kind of a reduction can I expect for '25, '26 onwards. And that's the question.

Marc Spieker: Yes. Let me start with the second one, Piotr. So as you know, we are not giving a mid-long-term guidance on price development as we are a business that passes on the fundamental costs onto our customers. What we do see is that what is relevant for our customers, it's the commodity piece and it's the network charges. What we've seen for this year is from this essentially a stable price outlook. We have always different customer segments that will be then adjusted. We also have market-by-market different hedging windows, so the impact of that can be from a timing point of view, a bit different. But essentially, for example, look at Germany, we have seen very little price adjustments this year. And this is on the back of lower commodity prices and somewhat increasing network tariffs. So all in all at this stage, limited impact. And then we need to see how commodity prices will develop over time but no further guidance as usual on how we see our end customer tariffs then moving. On the B2B business, we had actually been outspoken on that for the last 3, 4 years that we do not regard large industrial and commercial business as a strategically relevant segment for us. And to your question, therefore, in all other markets, we have moved out of that segment. So we are not running I&C retail businesses in any of the other markets. And the U.K. is the only one, and that is due to the specific situation of the Innogy integration and the Npower piece, which we had there, where we first focused on then kind of moving the E.ON and the Innogy business together on one platform. It is actually from a branding point of view still running on the Npower brand in the U.K. And this is why this is our only material B2B position and hence, no real read across to any other of our markets, at least what would be relevant for us.

Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, there are no further questions in the round. So I'll take this as a positive that we are delivering what we promised, and we are well on track. If there's anything that comes up after the call, the IR team is always is there to also answer any further questions that may be. With that, yes, I will close today's call.",za.investing.com,news,Investing.com South Africa,Read Earnings Call,0.223529411764706,453513453,11,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/1af84873d4affc3cf00a793fcdf317a7_w_800_h_450.jpg,eng-9569582

Marc Spieker is set to move from his role as CFO to Chief Operating Officer, Commercial, with Nadia Jakobi succeeding him as CFO in June.

The company reported a slight increase in EBITDA and net income, attributing the growth to strong operational execution. Planned capital expenditures have increased by 25% from the previous year, in line with the company's investment strategy. E.ON also revealed the reorganization of its Energy Infrastructure Solutions business into a stand-alone segment.

E.ON SE (EOAN) has been making strategic moves, as reflected in their recent financial results call, and the InvestingPro data and tips provide additional context to the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro, E.ON's Market Cap stands at a robust 37.64B USD, indicating the company's significant size and influence in the energy sector. Despite the company's strong market presence, the P/E Ratio is relatively high at 66.96, which may suggest that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its earnings.

InvestingPro Tips highlight that E.ON has raised its dividend for 7 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 33 consecutive years, underscoring the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders -- a positive sign for investors looking for stable income. This is particularly noteworthy as the company transitions leadership roles and continues to invest heavily in capital expenditures.

The company's status as a prominent player in the Multi-Utilities industry is reinforced by its consistent performance and strategic positioning. However, an InvestingPro Tip points out that E.ON may have trouble making interest payments on debt, which is an important consideration for investors, especially when evaluating the company's increased capital expenditures and the potential impact on its financial leverage.

Iris Eveleigh: Hello, everyone. Dear analysts and investors, welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm here with Marc Spieker, for whom this will be the last earnings call as CFO before he takes over his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Commercial. Marc, thank you very much for our successful earnings calls together. At the same time, I'm excited to have Nadia taking over as CFO in June, and I'm looking forward to having her join the earnings calls from our H1 results onwards. As for today's call, as usual, we will leave enough room for your questions after the presentation. With that, over to you, Marc.

Marc Spieker: Thank you, Iris, and a warm welcome from my side as well. I will save my goodbye words for later. Let us straight dive into the Q1 results, and let me start with highlighting the key messages for today. First message, Q1 came out in line with our expectations for all businesses. Key drivers of our slight EBITDA and net income increase, we're investing back earnings growth and strong operational execution more than offsetting the unwind of prior year one-off and timing effects. Second message. Our planned CapEx ramp-up is progressing well. We have accelerated again our spending by almost 25% year-over-year and are well on track in terms of quarterly fill rates across all business segments. Third message, our Q1 economic net debt came in as expected, showing the typical Q1 cash flow seasonality and the final outflows related to the unwinding of the positive one-off working capital effects that we have been reporting to you as of our 2022 results, and I'll come back to that later. Fourth and final message, we have a strong conviction in the relevant and long-term growth path of our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. To make our ambitions more visible, we are moving the business into a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards as announced. Finally, our guidance is fully confirmed. On to our Q1 EBITDA development. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at EUR 2.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year despite the lack of significant positive impacts from one-offs that we had seen in the prior year quarter. As expected, our Energy Networks business is slightly down in Q1 due to unwinding positive regulatory account effects of 2023, such as the benefit from lower redispatch costs, as well as slightly higher-than-expected costs from upstream networks in Germany. Additionally, we have changed the accounting for our Slovakian VSE business, to an equity consolidation, which leads to a technical reduction in EBITDA in our Central Eastern Europe business, no impact on net income. All those effects are economically neutral and they were largely offset by strong RAB driven earnings growth across all regions and the positive uplift of regulatory parameters in Sweden. Regarding network losses, Sweden and Slovakia have now completed their recoveries, while additional recoveries are now only happening in Southern Eastern Europe. You may have noted that we have now split our reporting of the CEE and Turkey segment into Central Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. This shall give you more transparency on our geographically well-diversified portfolio of networks businesses. The Central Eastern Europe segment covers Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Southeastern Europe segment includes our activities in Hungary, Romania and Turkey. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. New project commissioning is leading to EBITDA growth, as you would expect, supporting our 13% EBITDA accumulated average growth rate target from 2023 to 2028. This development is masked in Q1 by the absence of a positive one-off effect from last year and by changed intra-year maintenance schedule with a stronger focus on Q1 this year. With a change in maintenance schedule, we are partly mitigating also the negative effects from mild weather that we have been observing during the first quarter. In Energy Retail, the significant year-over-year EBITDA increase was primarily driven by positive price adjustments since Q1 last year. Additionally, we benefited from the improvement in our B2B segment in the U.K., which is successfully continuing its margin over volume strategy. Those positive effects were partially offset by the lack of procurement optimization benefits that we had seen in Q1 last year and it's a very favorable commodity price background last year and lower weather-driven volumes in Q1. Corporate Functions and Other segments saw an expected slight EBITDA decline driven by the lower results from our Turkish generation business due to the development of commodity prices also in Turkey. Moving on to our adjusted net income, which showed an increase of 2% which broadly follows the year-over-year EBITDA development. All earnings elements below EBITDA have developed in line with our expectations. The share of minority income sits at around 19% for the first quarter, as expected. And with that, materially below prior year. We expect this share to continue to go down and be lower for the full year as we communicated in our full year 2023 earnings release. Looking at the development of our economic net debt, I would like to highlight 3 points. First, our promised CapEx ramp-up is being executed like clockwork. We increased our Q1 investment spending by close to 25% year-over-year. I can assure you that we continue to be fully focused on ensuring a frictionless ramp up, managing closely our operations and supply chains. So far, we do not see any critical bottleneck on the horizon. Second, we have seen the typical operating cash outflow in Q1, which is driven by our seasonal business patterns in both Energy Retail and Energy Networks, specifically Energy Networks in Germany. As expected, this outflow was slightly amplified by the final unwind of our 2022 one-off working capital benefits. It's a long time ago, not everyone may remember, but our 2022 full year cash conversion set at a very benign 151%, significantly above the 100% we normally target. And as communicated in March for 2024, we are foreseeing a conversion rate of around 90%. And with that, the final reversal of these positive working capital effects from 2022 after 2024, we expect cash conversion to then swing back to the guided 100%. Third message on END, our strong balance sheet position has recently been confirmed by 2 of our rating agencies. We have received a rating upgrade by Standard & Poor's and a full rating confirmation by Moody's (NYSE:MCO). As communicated before, in line with our commitment to a strong BBB BAA rating, we have additional balance sheet capacity to fund further investments needed for a successful European energy transition if regulatory conditions further improve. Considering the balance sheet, it is also worth highlighting that we have already issued EUR 3.3 billion of bonds in the first quarter. With that, we have already fully covered our funding needs for 2024 and partially already prefunded 2025. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. As announced, we will report this business as a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards. Strategically and with a view to future growth, this segment is all about exploiting the huge business opportunities from decarbonization and to a large extent, electrification of the heating sector. The segment comprises our activities in designing, building, owning, operating and optimizing sustainable energy infrastructure assets for cities and business customers. Our solutions are based on modular standard building blocks, which are configured and digitally connected to fit specific customer needs. Technologically, our offerings include firstly, renewable on and offsite generation assets like photovoltaic and wind. Secondly, gas or biomass-fired heat and power engines. Thirdly, heat pumps and geothermal solutions. Fourthly, waste heat recovery technologies. And finally, high- and low-temperature heating and cooling grids. From a business point of view, we distinguish 2 clusters within Energy Infrastructure Solutions. First cluster is district heating and cooling, which is about running low-carbon heating and cooling networks in urban areas. Second business area is our industrial and commercial solutions business, offering on-site energy infrastructure for industrial and commercial customers. We have decided to also include our U.K. smart metering business in this segment, while technologically, obviously different in nature, it is a quasi-regulated business and hence, of similar nature when it comes to financial visibility and resilience. Let me remind you of some more financial and business characteristics relevant for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. Geographically, we are present in 15 countries, the key ones being Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Our pan-European coverage and strong regional anchoring represent a unique advantage to address our customers' needs for locally optimized energy infrastructure. Our strategy to standardize our offerings in a modular way will allow us to scale our solutions. Therefore, out of the EUR 5 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 years, 80% will be dedicated to growth investments. Through long-term contracts with customers, commodity price volatility and inflation are effectively passed through, for instance, via price escalation clauses. We ensure that any new project is targeted to deliver an internal rate of return spread over WACC of between 120 to 350 basis points. Furthermore, our rigorous focus on operational excellence ensures high asset availability. This is supported by digitalization, which helps to steer, monitor and effectively maintain and optimize the fleet of more than 6,000 assets. We expect annual EBITDA growth of 13% on average. Keep in mind that the municipal heat transition across Europe is still at an early stage. So there is more -- much more to come, but too soon for us to quantify what the impact will be over time. Let me close today's presentation with Slide 8 what you essentially should take away from us today. First, extremely solid Q1 outturn supports our expected earnings delivery for 2024. Second, our investment ramp-up is progressing well, which fully underpins the delivery of our midterm organic growth targets. Third, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We will continue to focus on delivering an attractive total shareholder return based on value creative organic growth and an annually growing dividend per share. And with that, let me move to a personal note. We announced in March that I would be moving on to take over as a Chief Operating Officer, the responsibility for our Energy Infrastructure and Retail Businesses from June onwards this year. We deliver what we promised. So inevitably, today is my last results call as CFO. It has been close to 8 years as CFO in the Board of Management of E.ON, hundreds of roadshows and exactly 30 results calls. I am not going away, but I will be focused on different things going forward. Great news for you is our investors and analysts that with Nadia Jakobi, I have the best successor I can think of. I know that with her, you, your interest and most importantly, your investments will continue to be in safe hands. Dear Iris, I would also like to express my thanks to the best Investor Relations team I can think of. And finally, it has been a privilege for me to represent our company in the capital markets. I'm extremely grateful for so many deep and thoughtful conversations during roadshows and other formats. And a big thank you to all of you for that. Before we get too sentimental, there is still business to be done. So let's move on to our Q&A session.

A - Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, we will start our Q&A session. Let me remind you all briefly, as you all do know, please stick to 2 questions each so that most of you have the chance to ask the questions. If there's anything we can't answer today, then the IR team is always there to also answer further questions from you. With that, the first question comes from Alberto from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

Alberto Gandolfi: Good morning, and Marc, thanks for all the help and all the best. We -- I guess we need to lean on you even more on the execution of all these EUR 20 billion CapEx plan. So congratulations, and thank you once more. Two questions on my side. The first one is a border line very boring, but can I understand, please, in the first quarter, what type of nonrecurring items we have in networks and in customer solutions. I'm trying to go to the underlying earnings power. So as I understand, you released some provisions. The weather was very mild, can you tell us if you booked negative and positive network losses, either recovery or cost? That is the first question. I have the feeling the underlying is stronger. That's why I'm asking. The second question is I've seen a DSO plan that implies that potentially if feasible, which I understand from what you're saying is not, your CapEx plan could be 50% higher than what you presented in March. What underpins the plus 50%. Is it possible you give us a view on what assumptions we would have to flex to have even more investments. Is this driven by power demand, electrification, more renewables, data centers or just to have a fee for written.

Marc Spieker: Yes. So Alberto, let me start with the nonrecurring items. Compared to last year, we had a lot of positive one-offs. In Q1 this year is much less impacted by any one-off effect. If you look at our Energy Networks business, I think the remaining piece that we see here is a mid-double-digit million euro amount of final recovery for network losses essentially relating to 2022. So there's still a minor positive one-off in our Energy Networks business. For Energy Retail, essentially, we talk about weather impact, which you may now call kind of extraordinary one-off or not. It's basically a -- it's a metric risk, which will hit us every year kind of in a positive or negative way in Q1 due to the mild temperatures, actually record mild temperatures. That was the second warmest Q1, I think, during the last 50 years. Not that I recollect that, but what the statistics tell and that was a mid-double-digit million euro negative impact. So across both segments, then it's a wash net nil impact from one-off essentially. Your question to CapEx spend there is very valid. And with that, you're referring to a publication that we have also done about the initial allocation plan, which is kind of an exercise, which is regularly done by the DSO in close alignment with the German regulator, where basically, on a regular basis, we look at what are actually the political targets for renewables build or for development of the energy system. Germany specifically relevant Easter package, and then it's broken down in a technical way. So what are, if you implement those targets as they are written, what would technically have to be done in order then to allow for these targets to be executed. And in that sense, this 50% upside to which you referred to, is to be taken with special care. First of all, it just reconfirms what we have been telling our shareholders also with our full year results that when it comes to our network growth plans, there is room for more if economic conditions are right. And this is what we are working on in that sense, there is no change to our communication in our plans that we will continue to be working with the relevant authorities to make sure that economic incentives are the right ones to support this, which is one of the constraints by the way, which this initial allocation plan does not include, but which by legislation is actually given. Secondly, it is a technical plan, which does not take into account practical constraints. And we have seen these practical constraints, particularly playing a role when it comes to permitting, just to mention one, and it would be unrealistic in our view to now assume that they're technically possible in an unconstrained way can be delivered with all the constraints which we have in a practical way. And in that sense, what you should take away is there is a huge potential for E.ON to further invest and accelerate our investments over time. And as just similar to our results, we also have the financial means to do this if the conditions set by the regulators fit.

Alberto Gandolfi: This is very clear. So if you just allow me a comment. You've done essentially if it's clean for Q1, you've done 36% of the midpoint of your guidance in Q1. So it seems you're leaving an easy rest of the year to Nadia from here.

Marc Spieker: I take this as a statement, which I'm not commenting on. We move on.

Iris Eveleigh: Exactly. So we move on to the next question. Thank you, Alberto. Next question comes from Harry from Exane.

Harry Peter Wyburd: So 2 for me. First, can I dig in a little bit to what's going on in U.K. B2B supply. Why is it that you're earning so much, you made so much in such a short period of time? Do you think this is an industry-wide phenomenon for the whole of the U.K. supply market? Or is it just something that you're doing as E.ON? And can you just help us understand a bit what size of clients are driving this very good performance. Are we talking about much smaller B2B customers or medium-sized, just a bit of color there would be very helpful. And second one is a bit more strategic and a bit of a follow-on from Alberto's questions on the CapEx. Is there any update or view from you on what your partners are doing or what others are doing in the German DNO market in terms of funding. Because I guess, if we're talking about an already upgraded CapEx plan potentially seeing even much more significant, more upside? And how are your partners going to fund this? And might we get into a situation where you're effectively incentivized to put your investment into your fully-owned DNO subsidiaries and not the ones where you've got partners because, of course, if your partners aren't putting capital in, it's harder for you to make a good return on your investment.

Marc Spieker: Just on the second one, when you are referring to partner, could you just specify what partners exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to our co-investors on some of the DSO or are you referring to the [indiscernible]? Okay. Good. So let me start with the second question. We see across the board an extremely strong alignment between our interest and the interest of our core investors on a DSO level, which are larger municipalities for a number of our German DSOs and there is a very strong focus on all of our sites to make the energy transition work. And if -- also from a funding point of view to make whatever is there needed and possible also then on the level of the DSO side. And generally, we do not see a particularly constraint on that side or a clash of interest nonesoever. On the I&C business in the U.K., it follows our strategy where we had said that in most markets, we want to exit large B2B customers. So to your question, what are the customers? It's large I&C clients. This is not small, medium enterprises. This is around large industrial and commercial customers. And the U.K. is the only market where we continue to run such a segment at scale. But this is why also strategically, we are very clear on that business, we'll have to be steered on margins and not on volume. So what we have been seeing this business doing is running on a smaller and smaller book and focusing more and more on those customers where we are able then to make a risk-adjusted fair margin if I look at the risk transformation that we're doing for these clients. I don't want to refer and can't refer now to whether that's an industry-wide phenomenon or not. What I can tell you that this is not a one-hit wonder, which has happened now in Q1. It is a development that we have been working for throughout the last 4 years with the continuous effort on managing our customer portfolio in that business.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Deepa from Bernstein.

Deepa Venkateswaran: And Marc, look forward to meeting you in person for your farewell events. So my 2 questions are actually centered around your German networks. So firstly, if I'm not mistaken, you were still awaiting for some more details on the current regulatory period. I was just wondering if you can update if there's been any change on the efficiency factors or anything. And the second one was looking forward to the next regulatory period, there's obviously a consultation out from the regulator to move to back and reduce the regulatory period. And then there's also the live court case that you have for the current period. So just wondering how you think the negotiations will evolve? And should we assume that if you're successful in the court case, the regulator -- I mean is there quid pro quo between getting a better deal post '29 and leaving some money on the table for existing assets now? Or how would you think of this discussion.

Marc Spieker: So where do we have news and where do we essentially looking at the same time line with no -- is expected no further update. So first of all, what we have seen since the full year results is the publication of the efficiency benchmark. And the good news is that E.ON continues to be very efficient, i.e., 100% efficient operator. And I think that underpins our strategic relevance and the efforts that we are doing and continuously focusing on operational excellence also in our Energy Networks business. There hasn't been a further update on then the general efficiency factor. So -- and that stands on the efficiency front. We have now a public confirmation about what we have been working towards any or as an ambition to be fully efficient and we now need to see how the regulator deals with the general efficiency factor. Still, this has not been published yet. On the consultation, then for the regulatory period starting 2028 for I guess '29 for power, no update essentially, Deepa that is worth relevant sharing here. I think what we continue to look at, first and foremost, is the proposal by the regulator. How to deal with depreciation schedules for existing gas networks. So this was one of the ideas expressed as part of the consultation paper where the regulator also pronounced that they were seeking there a fast solution. So kind of in the pipeline to expect is then a clarification by the regulator on how they intend to deal with existing gas networks, which is obviously also relevant for the energy transition in total. And for a lot of the market players, as you know for us gas networks has a very small share in our RAB but this is from a regulatory point of view, what we would expect to be the upcoming release. I think that's on the regulatory side.

Deepa Venkateswaran: Just the court case could you comment.

Marc Spieker: Court case, also no update. So we haven't seen any -- there hasn't been any specific intervention with the court, no hearing, et cetera. So nothing to update on that side.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, we move on to the questions from Wanda from UBS.

Unidentified Analyst: Marc, all the best, again. Two questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, Energy Retail, you had a very strong start into the year. Q1 EBITDA accounts for 50% of the full year guidance. So do you expect any reversal later this year? Or is there any buffer included in the guidance, something similar to what you did at the end of last year. And if there is any buffer, would you be able to quantify it? And the second question is on the UK Retail. In March [indiscernible] launched a discussion paper for the future of price protection, the [indiscernible] collection is upcoming. How do you see the market structure changing as the current one, the price cut doesn't really work.

Marc Spieker: So 2024 guidance, Wanda. I think what I would stress is that we are back basically in normal operations. So while the last 2 years have been very much affected by energy crisis and kind of the relief from the energy crisis. We are now more or less back in normal mode. And I think where we can take confidence from is how well we have managed the first quarter, which has been extremely mild. And this double-digit -- mid double-digit million euro negative impact from weather for the second warmest quarter during the last 50 years. That is a quite good performance. But it's too early now to say at this stage what that means for the remainder of the year. So for our guidance, take that we are managing towards the midpoint as usually. And at this stage, there's nothing that I would flag where we are particularly aggressive or conservative in the way how we have set our guidance. And apart from that, you always know that we deliver what we promise. So -- but the midpoint is what it is at this stage. On U.K. retail, there's not a lot that I would share now in this call except for that what we see is that the U.K. regulator has been much more constructive during the last years reacting to the industry's needs. Think we have also seen this -- of generally seen in Europe, the recognition also of retailers of being a system critical part of the energy value chain. And lastly, what I do see that E.ON specifically is being regarded by politicians and regulators as a company that stands in for the interest of customers and is driving the market to the benefit of the customers. And this gives us also where there are conversations, I think weighted the relevance in being heard in these discussions. And apart from that, it remains what I've said in the past that the U.K. regulation is very little wiggle room now to become worse because if you look at the results, which many of the operators in the U.K. are still achieving, it's not a marketplace where you could now easily just step in as a regulator and believe that U.K. worsening conditions, I think this is still a game about improving conditions to make these operations economically viable.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, next question comes from Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).

Rob Pulleyn: I have one question, which is quite high level, Marc. And that is, how does E.ON see power demand over time, given, of course, in 2023 it remains significantly lower than we saw precrisis in 2021. Is this structural loss due to industry. What about electrification trends you've spoken about? And also more recently, the data center demand, which we covered on the full year conference call. So I'd love to know what you think is a good suggestion for the medium-term power demand run rate we should be thinking for E.ON from here across the decade.

Marc Spieker: Yes, Rob, it's a very relevant long-term question, but happy to address that. So fundamentally, we are positive about the growth outlook of electricity volumes in our markets. So we expect electricity long term to be on a growth trend. Now when we talk about growth trends in energy, in developed markets, it's never high growth rates, but what we are seeing and expecting is a growth of 1%, 2% annually over time. And with that, of course, electricity will be the key carrier to replace then a number of primary fuels, specifically, you look at transportation, mineral oil, and if you look at heating mineral oil and gas. So growth outlook for electricity long term. And I think that is also important if you allow me that comment. If you look at the impact on affordability of the energy transition and then you should always keep in mind that all of these investments will be spread over time about much more volumes that will be wheeled in the system and increasingly bidirectional. So increasingly, our customers will also provide their power to the system. And so from that end, we are also confident that this will play out in a decent way.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Piotr from Citi.

Piotr Dzieciolowski: I have 2 questions, really. So firstly, I wanted to ask about the B2B business. Is this just the U.K. situation? Or this is also visible -- I know you don't have exposure, but this is also visible in the German and Benelux market? And why you saw [indiscernible] exclude the option to participate if there are some opportunities. You see the tender where the margin would be extremely high, why wouldn't you participate if the situation is similar in the continent? And second question I wanted to ask about your retail customer. Where are we in the process of passing through the lower falling commodity cost to the end customer deals. So if I were a customer in Germany, what kind of a reduction can I expect for '25, '26 onwards. And that's the question.

Marc Spieker: Yes. Let me start with the second one, Piotr. So as you know, we are not giving a mid-long-term guidance on price development as we are a business that passes on the fundamental costs onto our customers. What we do see is that what is relevant for our customers, it's the commodity piece and it's the network charges. What we've seen for this year is from this essentially a stable price outlook. We have always different customer segments that will be then adjusted. We also have market-by-market different hedging windows, so the impact of that can be from a timing point of view, a bit different. But essentially, for example, look at Germany, we have seen very little price adjustments this year. And this is on the back of lower commodity prices and somewhat increasing network tariffs. So all in all at this stage, limited impact. And then we need to see how commodity prices will develop over time but no further guidance as usual on how we see our end customer tariffs then moving. On the B2B business, we had actually been outspoken on that for the last 3, 4 years that we do not regard large industrial and commercial business as a strategically relevant segment for us. And to your question, therefore, in all other markets, we have moved out of that segment. So we are not running I&C retail businesses in any of the other markets. And the U.K. is the only one, and that is due to the specific situation of the Innogy integration and the Npower piece, which we had there, where we first focused on then kind of moving the E.ON and the Innogy business together on one platform. It is actually from a branding point of view still running on the Npower brand in the U.K. And this is why this is our only material B2B position and hence, no real read across to any other of our markets, at least what would be relevant for us.

Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, there are no further questions in the round. So I'll take this as a positive that we are delivering what we promised, and we are well on track. If there's anything that comes up after the call, the IR team is always is there to also answer any further questions that may be. With that, yes, I will close today's call.",uk.investing.com,news,Investing.com UK,,0.4823529411764707,453513417,11,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEBBR0PM_L.jpg,

Marc Spieker is set to move from his role as CFO to Chief Operating Officer, Commercial, with Nadia Jakobi succeeding him as CFO in June.

The company reported a slight increase in EBITDA and net income, attributing the growth to strong operational execution. Planned capital expenditures have increased by 25% from the previous year, in line with the company's investment strategy. E.ON also revealed the reorganization of its Energy Infrastructure Solutions business into a stand-alone segment.

E.ON SE (EOAN) has been making strategic moves, as reflected in their recent financial results call, and the InvestingPro data and tips provide additional context to the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro, E.ON's Market Cap stands at a robust 37.64B USD, indicating the company's significant size and influence in the energy sector. Despite the company's strong market presence, the P/E Ratio is relatively high at 66.96, which may suggest that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its earnings.

InvestingPro Tips highlight that E.ON has raised its dividend for 7 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 33 consecutive years, underscoring the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders -- a positive sign for investors looking for stable income. This is particularly noteworthy as the company transitions leadership roles and continues to invest heavily in capital expenditures.

The company's status as a prominent player in the Multi-Utilities industry is reinforced by its consistent performance and strategic positioning. However, an InvestingPro Tip points out that E.ON may have trouble making interest payments on debt, which is an important consideration for investors, especially when evaluating the company's increased capital expenditures and the potential impact on its financial leverage.

Iris Eveleigh: Hello, everyone. Dear analysts and investors, welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm here with Marc Spieker, for whom this will be the last earnings call as CFO before he takes over his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Commercial. Marc, thank you very much for our successful earnings calls together. At the same time, I'm excited to have Nadia taking over as CFO in June, and I'm looking forward to having her join the earnings calls from our H1 results onwards. As for today's call, as usual, we will leave enough room for your questions after the presentation. With that, over to you, Marc.

Marc Spieker: Thank you, Iris, and a warm welcome from my side as well. I will save my goodbye words for later. Let us straight dive into the Q1 results, and let me start with highlighting the key messages for today. First message, Q1 came out in line with our expectations for all businesses. Key drivers of our slight EBITDA and net income increase, we're investing back earnings growth and strong operational execution more than offsetting the unwind of prior year one-off and timing effects. Second message. Our planned CapEx ramp-up is progressing well. We have accelerated again our spending by almost 25% year-over-year and are well on track in terms of quarterly fill rates across all business segments. Third message, our Q1 economic net debt came in as expected, showing the typical Q1 cash flow seasonality and the final outflows related to the unwinding of the positive one-off working capital effects that we have been reporting to you as of our 2022 results, and I'll come back to that later. Fourth and final message, we have a strong conviction in the relevant and long-term growth path of our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. To make our ambitions more visible, we are moving the business into a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards as announced. Finally, our guidance is fully confirmed. On to our Q1 EBITDA development. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at EUR 2.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year despite the lack of significant positive impacts from one-offs that we had seen in the prior year quarter. As expected, our Energy Networks business is slightly down in Q1 due to unwinding positive regulatory account effects of 2023, such as the benefit from lower redispatch costs, as well as slightly higher-than-expected costs from upstream networks in Germany. Additionally, we have changed the accounting for our Slovakian VSE business, to an equity consolidation, which leads to a technical reduction in EBITDA in our Central Eastern Europe business, no impact on net income. All those effects are economically neutral and they were largely offset by strong RAB driven earnings growth across all regions and the positive uplift of regulatory parameters in Sweden. Regarding network losses, Sweden and Slovakia have now completed their recoveries, while additional recoveries are now only happening in Southern Eastern Europe. You may have noted that we have now split our reporting of the CEE and Turkey segment into Central Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. This shall give you more transparency on our geographically well-diversified portfolio of networks businesses. The Central Eastern Europe segment covers Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Southeastern Europe segment includes our activities in Hungary, Romania and Turkey. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. New project commissioning is leading to EBITDA growth, as you would expect, supporting our 13% EBITDA accumulated average growth rate target from 2023 to 2028. This development is masked in Q1 by the absence of a positive one-off effect from last year and by changed intra-year maintenance schedule with a stronger focus on Q1 this year. With a change in maintenance schedule, we are partly mitigating also the negative effects from mild weather that we have been observing during the first quarter. In Energy Retail, the significant year-over-year EBITDA increase was primarily driven by positive price adjustments since Q1 last year. Additionally, we benefited from the improvement in our B2B segment in the U.K., which is successfully continuing its margin over volume strategy. Those positive effects were partially offset by the lack of procurement optimization benefits that we had seen in Q1 last year and it's a very favorable commodity price background last year and lower weather-driven volumes in Q1. Corporate Functions and Other segments saw an expected slight EBITDA decline driven by the lower results from our Turkish generation business due to the development of commodity prices also in Turkey. Moving on to our adjusted net income, which showed an increase of 2% which broadly follows the year-over-year EBITDA development. All earnings elements below EBITDA have developed in line with our expectations. The share of minority income sits at around 19% for the first quarter, as expected. And with that, materially below prior year. We expect this share to continue to go down and be lower for the full year as we communicated in our full year 2023 earnings release. Looking at the development of our economic net debt, I would like to highlight 3 points. First, our promised CapEx ramp-up is being executed like clockwork. We increased our Q1 investment spending by close to 25% year-over-year. I can assure you that we continue to be fully focused on ensuring a frictionless ramp up, managing closely our operations and supply chains. So far, we do not see any critical bottleneck on the horizon. Second, we have seen the typical operating cash outflow in Q1, which is driven by our seasonal business patterns in both Energy Retail and Energy Networks, specifically Energy Networks in Germany. As expected, this outflow was slightly amplified by the final unwind of our 2022 one-off working capital benefits. It's a long time ago, not everyone may remember, but our 2022 full year cash conversion set at a very benign 151%, significantly above the 100% we normally target. And as communicated in March for 2024, we are foreseeing a conversion rate of around 90%. And with that, the final reversal of these positive working capital effects from 2022 after 2024, we expect cash conversion to then swing back to the guided 100%. Third message on END, our strong balance sheet position has recently been confirmed by 2 of our rating agencies. We have received a rating upgrade by Standard & Poor's and a full rating confirmation by Moody's (NYSE:MCO). As communicated before, in line with our commitment to a strong BBB BAA rating, we have additional balance sheet capacity to fund further investments needed for a successful European energy transition if regulatory conditions further improve. Considering the balance sheet, it is also worth highlighting that we have already issued EUR 3.3 billion of bonds in the first quarter. With that, we have already fully covered our funding needs for 2024 and partially already prefunded 2025. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. As announced, we will report this business as a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards. Strategically and with a view to future growth, this segment is all about exploiting the huge business opportunities from decarbonization and to a large extent, electrification of the heating sector. The segment comprises our activities in designing, building, owning, operating and optimizing sustainable energy infrastructure assets for cities and business customers. Our solutions are based on modular standard building blocks, which are configured and digitally connected to fit specific customer needs. Technologically, our offerings include firstly, renewable on and offsite generation assets like photovoltaic and wind. Secondly, gas or biomass-fired heat and power engines. Thirdly, heat pumps and geothermal solutions. Fourthly, waste heat recovery technologies. And finally, high- and low-temperature heating and cooling grids. From a business point of view, we distinguish 2 clusters within Energy Infrastructure Solutions. First cluster is district heating and cooling, which is about running low-carbon heating and cooling networks in urban areas. Second business area is our industrial and commercial solutions business, offering on-site energy infrastructure for industrial and commercial customers. We have decided to also include our U.K. smart metering business in this segment, while technologically, obviously different in nature, it is a quasi-regulated business and hence, of similar nature when it comes to financial visibility and resilience. Let me remind you of some more financial and business characteristics relevant for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. Geographically, we are present in 15 countries, the key ones being Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Our pan-European coverage and strong regional anchoring represent a unique advantage to address our customers' needs for locally optimized energy infrastructure. Our strategy to standardize our offerings in a modular way will allow us to scale our solutions. Therefore, out of the EUR 5 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 years, 80% will be dedicated to growth investments. Through long-term contracts with customers, commodity price volatility and inflation are effectively passed through, for instance, via price escalation clauses. We ensure that any new project is targeted to deliver an internal rate of return spread over WACC of between 120 to 350 basis points. Furthermore, our rigorous focus on operational excellence ensures high asset availability. This is supported by digitalization, which helps to steer, monitor and effectively maintain and optimize the fleet of more than 6,000 assets. We expect annual EBITDA growth of 13% on average. Keep in mind that the municipal heat transition across Europe is still at an early stage. So there is more -- much more to come, but too soon for us to quantify what the impact will be over time. Let me close today's presentation with Slide 8 what you essentially should take away from us today. First, extremely solid Q1 outturn supports our expected earnings delivery for 2024. Second, our investment ramp-up is progressing well, which fully underpins the delivery of our midterm organic growth targets. Third, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We will continue to focus on delivering an attractive total shareholder return based on value creative organic growth and an annually growing dividend per share. And with that, let me move to a personal note. We announced in March that I would be moving on to take over as a Chief Operating Officer, the responsibility for our Energy Infrastructure and Retail Businesses from June onwards this year. We deliver what we promised. So inevitably, today is my last results call as CFO. It has been close to 8 years as CFO in the Board of Management of E.ON, hundreds of roadshows and exactly 30 results calls. I am not going away, but I will be focused on different things going forward. Great news for you is our investors and analysts that with Nadia Jakobi, I have the best successor I can think of. I know that with her, you, your interest and most importantly, your investments will continue to be in safe hands. Dear Iris, I would also like to express my thanks to the best Investor Relations team I can think of. And finally, it has been a privilege for me to represent our company in the capital markets. I'm extremely grateful for so many deep and thoughtful conversations during roadshows and other formats. And a big thank you to all of you for that. Before we get too sentimental, there is still business to be done. So let's move on to our Q&A session.

A - Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, we will start our Q&A session. Let me remind you all briefly, as you all do know, please stick to 2 questions each so that most of you have the chance to ask the questions. If there's anything we can't answer today, then the IR team is always there to also answer further questions from you. With that, the first question comes from Alberto from Goldman Sachs.

Alberto Gandolfi: Good morning, and Marc, thanks for all the help and all the best. We -- I guess we need to lean on you even more on the execution of all these EUR 20 billion CapEx plan. So congratulations, and thank you once more. Two questions on my side. The first one is a border line very boring, but can I understand, please, in the first quarter, what type of nonrecurring items we have in networks and in customer solutions. I'm trying to go to the underlying earnings power. So as I understand, you released some provisions. The weather was very mild, can you tell us if you booked negative and positive network losses, either recovery or cost? That is the first question. I have the feeling the underlying is stronger. That's why I'm asking. The second question is I've seen a DSO plan that implies that potentially if feasible, which I understand from what you're saying is not, your CapEx plan could be 50% higher than what you presented in March. What underpins the plus 50%. Is it possible you give us a view on what assumptions we would have to flex to have even more investments. Is this driven by power demand, electrification, more renewables, data centers or just to have a fee for written.

Marc Spieker: Yes. So Alberto, let me start with the nonrecurring items. Compared to last year, we had a lot of positive one-offs. In Q1 this year is much less impacted by any one-off effect. If you look at our Energy Networks business, I think the remaining piece that we see here is a mid-double-digit million euro amount of final recovery for network losses essentially relating to 2022. So there's still a minor positive one-off in our Energy Networks business. For Energy Retail, essentially, we talk about weather impact, which you may now call kind of extraordinary one-off or not. It's basically a -- it's a metric risk, which will hit us every year kind of in a positive or negative way in Q1 due to the mild temperatures, actually record mild temperatures. That was the second warmest Q1, I think, during the last 50 years. Not that I recollect that, but what the statistics tell and that was a mid-double-digit million euro negative impact. So across both segments, then it's a wash net nil impact from one-off essentially. Your question to CapEx spend there is very valid. And with that, you're referring to a publication that we have also done about the initial allocation plan, which is kind of an exercise, which is regularly done by the DSO in close alignment with the German regulator, where basically, on a regular basis, we look at what are actually the political targets for renewables build or for development of the energy system. Germany specifically relevant Easter package, and then it's broken down in a technical way. So what are, if you implement those targets as they are written, what would technically have to be done in order then to allow for these targets to be executed. And in that sense, this 50% upside to which you referred to, is to be taken with special care. First of all, it just reconfirms what we have been telling our shareholders also with our full year results that when it comes to our network growth plans, there is room for more if economic conditions are right. And this is what we are working on in that sense, there is no change to our communication in our plans that we will continue to be working with the relevant authorities to make sure that economic incentives are the right ones to support this, which is one of the constraints by the way, which this initial allocation plan does not include, but which by legislation is actually given. Secondly, it is a technical plan, which does not take into account practical constraints. And we have seen these practical constraints, particularly playing a role when it comes to permitting, just to mention one, and it would be unrealistic in our view to now assume that they're technically possible in an unconstrained way can be delivered with all the constraints which we have in a practical way. And in that sense, what you should take away is there is a huge potential for E.ON to further invest and accelerate our investments over time. And as just similar to our results, we also have the financial means to do this if the conditions set by the regulators fit.

Alberto Gandolfi: This is very clear. So if you just allow me a comment. You've done essentially if it's clean for Q1, you've done 36% of the midpoint of your guidance in Q1. So it seems you're leaving an easy rest of the year to Nadia from here.

Marc Spieker: I take this as a statement, which I'm not commenting on. We move on.

Iris Eveleigh: Exactly. So we move on to the next question. Thank you, Alberto. Next question comes from Harry from Exane.

Harry Peter Wyburd: So 2 for me. First, can I dig in a little bit to what's going on in U.K. B2B supply. Why is it that you're earning so much, you made so much in such a short period of time? Do you think this is an industry-wide phenomenon for the whole of the U.K. supply market? Or is it just something that you're doing as E.ON? And can you just help us understand a bit what size of clients are driving this very good performance. Are we talking about much smaller B2B customers or medium-sized, just a bit of color there would be very helpful. And second one is a bit more strategic and a bit of a follow-on from Alberto's questions on the CapEx. Is there any update or view from you on what your partners are doing or what others are doing in the German DNO market in terms of funding. Because I guess, if we're talking about an already upgraded CapEx plan potentially seeing even much more significant, more upside? And how are your partners going to fund this? And might we get into a situation where you're effectively incentivized to put your investment into your fully-owned DNO subsidiaries and not the ones where you've got partners because, of course, if your partners aren't putting capital in, it's harder for you to make a good return on your investment.

Marc Spieker: Just on the second one, when you are referring to partner, could you just specify what partners exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to our co-investors on some of the DSO or are you referring to the [indiscernible]? Okay. Good. So let me start with the second question. We see across the board an extremely strong alignment between our interest and the interest of our core investors on a DSO level, which are larger municipalities for a number of our German DSOs and there is a very strong focus on all of our sites to make the energy transition work. And if -- also from a funding point of view to make whatever is there needed and possible also then on the level of the DSO side. And generally, we do not see a particularly constraint on that side or a clash of interest nonesoever. On the I&C business in the U.K., it follows our strategy where we had said that in most markets, we want to exit large B2B customers. So to your question, what are the customers? It's large I&C clients. This is not small, medium enterprises. This is around large industrial and commercial customers. And the U.K. is the only market where we continue to run such a segment at scale. But this is why also strategically, we are very clear on that business, we'll have to be steered on margins and not on volume. So what we have been seeing this business doing is running on a smaller and smaller book and focusing more and more on those customers where we are able then to make a risk-adjusted fair margin if I look at the risk transformation that we're doing for these clients. I don't want to refer and can't refer now to whether that's an industry-wide phenomenon or not. What I can tell you that this is not a one-hit wonder, which has happened now in Q1. It is a development that we have been working for throughout the last 4 years with the continuous effort on managing our customer portfolio in that business.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Deepa from Bernstein.

Deepa Venkateswaran: And Marc, look forward to meeting you in person for your farewell events. So my 2 questions are actually centered around your German networks. So firstly, if I'm not mistaken, you were still awaiting for some more details on the current regulatory period. I was just wondering if you can update if there's been any change on the efficiency factors or anything. And the second one was looking forward to the next regulatory period, there's obviously a consultation out from the regulator to move to back and reduce the regulatory period. And then there's also the live court case that you have for the current period. So just wondering how you think the negotiations will evolve? And should we assume that if you're successful in the court case, the regulator -- I mean is there quid pro quo between getting a better deal post '29 and leaving some money on the table for existing assets now? Or how would you think of this discussion.

Marc Spieker: So where do we have news and where do we essentially looking at the same time line with no -- is expected no further update. So first of all, what we have seen since the full year results is the publication of the efficiency benchmark. And the good news is that E.ON continues to be very efficient, i.e., 100% efficient operator. And I think that underpins our strategic relevance and the efforts that we are doing and continuously focusing on operational excellence also in our Energy Networks business. There hasn't been a further update on then the general efficiency factor. So -- and that stands on the efficiency front. We have now a public confirmation about what we have been working towards any or as an ambition to be fully efficient and we now need to see how the regulator deals with the general efficiency factor. Still, this has not been published yet. On the consultation, then for the regulatory period starting 2028 for I guess '29 for power, no update essentially, Deepa that is worth relevant sharing here. I think what we continue to look at, first and foremost, is the proposal by the regulator. How to deal with depreciation schedules for existing gas networks. So this was one of the ideas expressed as part of the consultation paper where the regulator also pronounced that they were seeking there a fast solution. So kind of in the pipeline to expect is then a clarification by the regulator on how they intend to deal with existing gas networks, which is obviously also relevant for the energy transition in total. And for a lot of the market players, as you know for us gas networks has a very small share in our RAB but this is from a regulatory point of view, what we would expect to be the upcoming release. I think that's on the regulatory side.

Deepa Venkateswaran: Just the court case could you comment.

Marc Spieker: Court case, also no update. So we haven't seen any -- there hasn't been any specific intervention with the court, no hearing, et cetera. So nothing to update on that side.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, we move on to the questions from Wanda from UBS.

Unidentified Analyst: Marc, all the best, again. Two questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, Energy Retail, you had a very strong start into the year. Q1 EBITDA accounts for 50% of the full year guidance. So do you expect any reversal later this year? Or is there any buffer included in the guidance, something similar to what you did at the end of last year. And if there is any buffer, would you be able to quantify it? And the second question is on the UK Retail. In March [indiscernible] launched a discussion paper for the future of price protection, the [indiscernible] collection is upcoming. How do you see the market structure changing as the current one, the price cut doesn't really work.

Marc Spieker: So 2024 guidance, Wanda. I think what I would stress is that we are back basically in normal operations. So while the last 2 years have been very much affected by energy crisis and kind of the relief from the energy crisis. We are now more or less back in normal mode. And I think where we can take confidence from is how well we have managed the first quarter, which has been extremely mild. And this double-digit -- mid double-digit million euro negative impact from weather for the second warmest quarter during the last 50 years. That is a quite good performance. But it's too early now to say at this stage what that means for the remainder of the year. So for our guidance, take that we are managing towards the midpoint as usually. And at this stage, there's nothing that I would flag where we are particularly aggressive or conservative in the way how we have set our guidance. And apart from that, you always know that we deliver what we promise. So -- but the midpoint is what it is at this stage. On U.K. retail, there's not a lot that I would share now in this call except for that what we see is that the U.K. regulator has been much more constructive during the last years reacting to the industry's needs. Think we have also seen this -- of generally seen in Europe, the recognition also of retailers of being a system critical part of the energy value chain. And lastly, what I do see that E.ON specifically is being regarded by politicians and regulators as a company that stands in for the interest of customers and is driving the market to the benefit of the customers. And this gives us also where there are conversations, I think weighted the relevance in being heard in these discussions. And apart from that, it remains what I've said in the past that the U.K. regulation is very little wiggle room now to become worse because if you look at the results, which many of the operators in the U.K. are still achieving, it's not a marketplace where you could now easily just step in as a regulator and believe that U.K. worsening conditions, I think this is still a game about improving conditions to make these operations economically viable.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, next question comes from Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley.

Rob Pulleyn: I have one question, which is quite high level, Marc. And that is, how does E.ON see power demand over time, given, of course, in 2023 it remains significantly lower than we saw precrisis in 2021. Is this structural loss due to industry. What about electrification trends you've spoken about? And also more recently, the data center demand, which we covered on the full year conference call. So I'd love to know what you think is a good suggestion for the medium-term power demand run rate we should be thinking for E.ON from here across the decade.

Marc Spieker: Yes, Rob, it's a very relevant long-term question, but happy to address that. So fundamentally, we are positive about the growth outlook of electricity volumes in our markets. So we expect electricity long term to be on a growth trend. Now when we talk about growth trends in energy, in developed markets, it's never high growth rates, but what we are seeing and expecting is a growth of 1%, 2% annually over time. And with that, of course, electricity will be the key carrier to replace then a number of primary fuels, specifically, you look at transportation, mineral oil, and if you look at heating mineral oil and gas. So growth outlook for electricity long term. And I think that is also important if you allow me that comment. If you look at the impact on affordability of the energy transition and then you should always keep in mind that all of these investments will be spread over time about much more volumes that will be wheeled in the system and increasingly bidirectional. So increasingly, our customers will also provide their power to the system. And so from that end, we are also confident that this will play out in a decent way.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Piotr from Citi.

Piotr Dzieciolowski: I have 2 questions, really. So firstly, I wanted to ask about the B2B business. Is this just the U.K. situation? Or this is also visible -- I know you don't have exposure, but this is also visible in the German and Benelux market? And why you saw [indiscernible] exclude the option to participate if there are some opportunities. You see the tender where the margin would be extremely high, why wouldn't you participate if the situation is similar in the continent? And second question I wanted to ask about your retail customer. Where are we in the process of passing through the lower falling commodity cost to the end customer deals. So if I were a customer in Germany, what kind of a reduction can I expect for '25, '26 onwards. And that's the question.

Marc Spieker: Yes. Let me start with the second one, Piotr. So as you know, we are not giving a mid-long-term guidance on price development as we are a business that passes on the fundamental costs onto our customers. What we do see is that what is relevant for our customers, it's the commodity piece and it's the network charges. What we've seen for this year is from this essentially a stable price outlook. We have always different customer segments that will be then adjusted. We also have market-by-market different hedging windows, so the impact of that can be from a timing point of view, a bit different. But essentially, for example, look at Germany, we have seen very little price adjustments this year. And this is on the back of lower commodity prices and somewhat increasing network tariffs. So all in all at this stage, limited impact. And then we need to see how commodity prices will develop over time but no further guidance as usual on how we see our end customer tariffs then moving. On the B2B business, we had actually been outspoken on that for the last 3, 4 years that we do not regard large industrial and commercial business as a strategically relevant segment for us. And to your question, therefore, in all other markets, we have moved out of that segment. So we are not running I&C retail businesses in any of the other markets. And the U.K. is the only one, and that is due to the specific situation of the Innogy integration and the Npower piece, which we had there, where we first focused on then kind of moving the E.ON and the Innogy business together on one platform. It is actually from a branding point of view still running on the Npower brand in the U.K. And this is why this is our only material B2B position and hence, no real read across to any other of our markets, at least what would be relevant for us.

Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, there are no further questions in the round. So I'll take this as a positive that we are delivering what we promised, and we are well on track. If there's anything that comes up after the call, the IR team is always is there to also answer any further questions that may be. With that, yes, I will close today's call.",investing.com,news,Investing.com,,0.4823529411764707,453513188,11,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEBBR0PM_L.jpg,eng-9569582

Hello, everyone. Dear analysts and investors, welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm here with Marc Spieker, for whom this will be the last earnings call as CFO before he takes over his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Commercial. Marc, thank you very much for our successful earnings calls together. At the same time, I'm excited to have Nadia taking over as CFO in June, and I'm looking forward to having her join the earnings calls from our H1 results onwards. As for today's call, as usual, we will leave enough room for your questions after the presentation.

Thank you, Iris, and a warm welcome from my side as well. I will save my goodbye words for later. Let us straight dive into the Q1 results, and let me start with highlighting the key messages for today. First message, Q1 came out in line with our expectations for all businesses. Key drivers of our slight EBITDA and net income increase, we're investing back earnings growth and strong operational execution more than offsetting the unwind of prior year one-off and timing effects.

Second message. Our planned CapEx ramp-up is progressing well. We have accelerated again our spending by almost 25% year-over-year and are well on track in terms of quarterly fill rates across all business segments.

Third message, our Q1 economic net debt came in as expected, showing the typical Q1 cash flow seasonality and the final outflows related to the unwinding of the positive one-off working capital effects that we have been reporting to you as of our 2022 results, and I'll come back to that later.

Fourth and final message, we have a strong conviction in the relevant and long-term growth path of our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. To make our ambitions more visible, we are moving the business into a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards as announced. Finally, our guidance is fully confirmed.

On to our Q1 EBITDA development. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at EUR 2.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year despite the lack of significant positive impacts from one-offs that we had seen in the prior year quarter. As expected, our Energy Networks business is slightly down in Q1 due to unwinding positive regulatory account effects of 2023, such as the benefit from lower redispatch costs, as well as slightly higher-than-expected costs from upstream networks in Germany. Additionally, we have changed the accounting for our Slovakian VSE business, to an equity consolidation, which leads to a technical reduction in EBITDA in our Central Eastern Europe business, no impact on net income.

All those effects are economically neutral and they were largely offset by strong RAB driven earnings growth across all regions and the positive uplift of regulatory parameters in Sweden. Regarding network losses, Sweden and Slovakia have now completed their recoveries, while additional recoveries are now only happening in Southern Eastern Europe. You may have noted that we have now split our reporting of the CEE and Turkey segment into Central Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. This shall give you more transparency on our geographically well-diversified portfolio of networks businesses. The Central Eastern Europe segment covers Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Southeastern Europe segment includes our activities in Hungary, Romania and Turkey.

Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. New project commissioning is leading to EBITDA growth, as you would expect, supporting our 13% EBITDA accumulated average growth rate target from 2023 to 2028. This development is masked in Q1 by the absence of a positive one-off effect from last year and by changed intra-year maintenance schedule with a stronger focus on Q1 this year. With a change in maintenance schedule, we are partly mitigating also the negative effects from mild weather that we have been observing during the first quarter. In Energy Retail, the significant year-over-year EBITDA increase was primarily driven by positive price adjustments since Q1 last year. Additionally, we benefited from the improvement in our B2B segment in the U.K., which is successfully continuing its margin over volume strategy.

Those positive effects were partially offset by the lack of procurement optimization benefits that we had seen in Q1 last year and it's a very favorable commodity price background last year and lower weather-driven volumes in Q1. Corporate Functions and Other segments saw an expected slight EBITDA decline driven by the lower results from our Turkish generation business due to the development of commodity prices also in Turkey.

Moving on to our adjusted net income, which showed an increase of 2% which broadly follows the year-over-year EBITDA development. All earnings elements below EBITDA have developed in line with our expectations. The share of minority income sits at around 19% for the first quarter, as expected. And with that, materially below prior year. We expect this share to continue to go down and be lower for the full year as we communicated in our full year 2023 earnings release. Looking at the development of our economic net debt, I would like to highlight 3 points.

First, our promised CapEx ramp-up is being executed like clockwork. We increased our Q1 investment spending by close to 25% year-over-year. I can assure you that we continue to be fully focused on ensuring a frictionless ramp up, managing closely our operations and supply chains. So far, we do not see any critical bottleneck on the horizon.

Second, we have seen the typical operating cash outflow in Q1, which is driven by our seasonal business patterns in both Energy Retail and Energy Networks, specifically Energy Networks in Germany. As expected, this outflow was slightly amplified by the final unwind of our 2022 one-off working capital benefits. It's a long time ago, not everyone may remember, but our 2022 full year cash conversion set at a very benign 151%, significantly above the 100% we normally target. And as communicated in March for 2024, we are foreseeing a conversion rate of around 90%. And with that, the final reversal of these positive working capital effects from 2022 after 2024, we expect cash conversion to then swing back to the guided 100%.

Third message on END, our strong balance sheet position has recently been confirmed by 2 of our rating agencies. We have received a rating upgrade by Standard & Poor's and a full rating confirmation by Moody's. As communicated before, in line with our commitment to a strong BBB BAA rating, we have additional balance sheet capacity to fund further investments needed for a successful European energy transition if regulatory conditions further improve. Considering the balance sheet, it is also worth highlighting that we have already issued EUR 3.3 billion of bonds in the first quarter. With that, we have already fully covered our funding needs for 2024 and partially already prefunded 2025.

Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. As announced, we will report this business as a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards. Strategically and with a view to future growth, this segment is all about exploiting the huge business opportunities from decarbonization and to a large extent, electrification of the heating sector. The segment comprises our activities in designing, building, owning, operating and optimizing sustainable energy infrastructure assets for cities and business customers. Our solutions are based on modular standard building blocks, which are configured and digitally connected to fit specific customer needs.

Technologically, our offerings include firstly, renewable on and offsite generation assets like photovoltaic and wind. Secondly, gas or biomass-fired heat and power engines. Thirdly, heat pumps and geothermal solutions. Fourthly, waste heat recovery technologies. And finally, high- and low-temperature heating and cooling grids. From a business point of view, we distinguish 2 clusters within Energy Infrastructure Solutions. First cluster is district heating and cooling, which is about running low-carbon heating and cooling networks in urban areas. Second business area is our industrial and commercial solutions business, offering on-site energy infrastructure for industrial and commercial customers.

We have decided to also include our U.K. smart metering business in this segment, while technologically, obviously different in nature, it is a quasi-regulated business and hence, of similar nature when it comes to financial visibility and resilience. Let me remind you of some more financial and business characteristics relevant for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. Geographically, we are present in 15 countries, the key ones being Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Our pan-European coverage and strong regional anchoring represent a unique advantage to address our customers' needs for locally optimized energy infrastructure. Our strategy to standardize our offerings in a modular way will allow us to scale our solutions.

Therefore, out of the EUR 5 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 years, 80% will be dedicated to growth investments. Through long-term contracts with customers, commodity price volatility and inflation are effectively passed through, for instance, via price escalation clauses. We ensure that any new project is targeted to deliver an internal rate of return spread over WACC of between 120 to 350 basis points. Furthermore, our rigorous focus on operational excellence ensures high asset availability. This is supported by digitalization, which helps to steer, monitor and effectively maintain and optimize the fleet of more than 6,000 assets. We expect annual EBITDA growth of 13% on average. Keep in mind that the municipal heat transition across Europe is still at an early stage. So there is more -- much more to come, but too soon for us to quantify what the impact will be over time.

Let me close today's presentation with Slide 8 what you essentially should take away from us today. First, extremely solid Q1 outturn supports our expected earnings delivery for 2024. Second, our investment ramp-up is progressing well, which fully underpins the delivery of our midterm organic growth targets. Third, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We will continue to focus on delivering an attractive total shareholder return based on value creative organic growth and an annually growing dividend per share. And with that, let me move to a personal note.

We announced in March that I would be moving on to take over as a Chief Operating Officer, the responsibility for our Energy Infrastructure and Retail Businesses from June onwards this year. We deliver what we promised. So inevitably, today is my last results call as CFO. It has been close to 8 years as CFO in the Board of Management of E.ON, hundreds of roadshows and exactly 30 results calls. I am not going away, but I will be focused on different things going forward. Great news for you is our investors and analysts that with Nadia Jakobi, I have the best successor I can think of. I know that with her, you, your interest and most importantly, your investments will continue to be in safe hands.

Dear Iris, I would also like to express my thanks to the best Investor Relations team I can think of. And finally, it has been a privilege for me to represent our company in the capital markets. I'm extremely grateful for so many deep and thoughtful conversations during roadshows and other formats. And a big thank you to all of you for that. Before we get too sentimental, there is still business to be done. So let's move on to our Q&A session.

Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, we will start our Q&A session. Let me remind you all briefly, as you all do know, please stick to 2 questions each so that most of you have the chance to ask the questions. If there's anything we can't answer today, then the IR team is always there to also answer further questions from you. With that, the first question comes from Alberto from Goldman Sachs.

Alberto Gandolfi

Good morning, and Marc, thanks for all the help and all the best. We -- I guess we need to lean on you even more on the execution of all these EUR 20 billion CapEx plan. So congratulations, and thank you once more. Two questions on my side. The first one is a border line very boring, but can I understand, please, in the first quarter, what type of nonrecurring items we have in networks and in customer solutions. I'm trying to go to the underlying earnings power. So as I understand, you released some provisions. The weather was very mild, can you tell us if you booked negative and positive network losses, either recovery or cost? That is the first question. I have the feeling the underlying is stronger. That's why I'm asking.

The second question is I've seen a DSO plan that implies that potentially if feasible, which I understand from what you're saying is not, your CapEx plan could be 50% higher than what you presented in March. What underpins the plus 50%. Is it possible you give us a view on what assumptions we would have to flex to have even more investments. Is this driven by power demand, electrification, more renewables, data centers or just to have a fee for written.

Marc Spieker

Yes. So Alberto, let me start with the nonrecurring items. Compared to last year, we had a lot of positive one-offs. In Q1 this year is much less impacted by any one-off effect. If you look at our Energy Networks business, I think the remaining piece that we see here is a mid-double-digit million euro amount of final recovery for network losses essentially relating to 2022. So there's still a minor positive one-off in our Energy Networks business.

For Energy Retail, essentially, we talk about weather impact, which you may now call kind of extraordinary one-off or not. It's basically a -- it's a metric risk, which will hit us every year kind of in a positive or negative way in Q1 due to the mild temperatures, actually record mild temperatures. That was the second warmest Q1, I think, during the last 50 years. Not that I recollect that, but what the statistics tell and that was a mid-double-digit million euro negative impact.

So across both segments, then it's a wash net nil impact from one-off essentially. Your question to CapEx spend there is very valid. And with that, you're referring to a publication that we have also done about the initial allocation plan, which is kind of an exercise, which is regularly done by the DSO in close alignment with the German regulator, where basically, on a regular basis, we look at what are actually the political targets for renewables build or for development of the energy system. Germany specifically relevant Easter package, and then it's broken down in a technical way. So what are, if you implement those targets as they are written, what would technically have to be done in order then to allow for these targets to be executed. And in that sense, this 50% upside to which you referred to, is to be taken with special care.

First of all, it just reconfirms what we have been telling our shareholders also with our full year results that when it comes to our network growth plans, there is room for more if economic conditions are right. And this is what we are working on in that sense, there is no change to our communication in our plans that we will continue to be working with the relevant authorities to make sure that economic incentives are the right ones to support this, which is one of the constraints by the way, which this initial allocation plan does not include, but which by legislation is actually given.

Secondly, it is a technical plan, which does not take into account practical constraints. And we have seen these practical constraints, particularly playing a role when it comes to permitting, just to mention one, and it would be unrealistic in our view to now assume that they're technically possible in an unconstrained way can be delivered with all the constraints which we have in a practical way. And in that sense, what you should take away is there is a huge potential for E.ON to further invest and accelerate our investments over time. And as just similar to our results, we also have the financial means to do this if the conditions set by the regulators fit.

Alberto Gandolfi

This is very clear. So if you just allow me a comment. You've done essentially if it's clean for Q1, you've done 36% of the midpoint of your guidance in Q1. So it seems you're leaving an easy rest of the year to Nadia from here.

Marc Spieker

I take this as a statement, which I'm not commenting on. We move on.

Iris Eveleigh

Exactly. So we move on to the next question. Thank you, Alberto. Next question comes from Harry from Exane.

Harry Peter Wyburd

So 2 for me. First, can I dig in a little bit to what's going on in U.K. B2B supply. Why is it that you're earning so much, you made so much in such a short period of time? Do you think this is an industry-wide phenomenon for the whole of the U.K. supply market? Or is it just something that you're doing as E.ON? And can you just help us understand a bit what size of clients are driving this very good performance.

Are we talking about much smaller B2B customers or medium-sized, just a bit of color there would be very helpful. And second one is a bit more strategic and a bit of a follow-on from Alberto's questions on the CapEx. Is there any update or view from you on what your partners are doing or what others are doing in the German DNO market in terms of funding. Because I guess, if we're talking about an already upgraded CapEx plan potentially seeing even much more significant, more upside? And how are your partners going to fund this? And might we get into a situation where you're effectively incentivized to put your investment into your fully-owned DNO subsidiaries and not the ones where you've got partners because, of course, if your partners aren't putting capital in, it's harder for you to make a good return on your investment.

Marc Spieker

Just on the second one, when you are referring to partner, could you just specify what partners exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to our co-investors on some of the DSO or are you referring to the [indiscernible]? Okay. Good.

So let me start with the second question. We see across the board an extremely strong alignment between our interest and the interest of our core investors on a DSO level, which are larger municipalities for a number of our German DSOs and there is a very strong focus on all of our sites to make the energy transition work. And if -- also from a funding point of view to make whatever is there needed and possible also then on the level of the DSO side. And generally, we do not see a particularly constraint on that side or a clash of interest nonesoever. On the I&C business in the U.K., it follows our strategy where we had said that in most markets, we want to exit large B2B customers. So to your question, what are the customers? It's large I&C clients. This is not small, medium enterprises.

This is around large industrial and commercial customers. And the U.K. is the only market where we continue to run such a segment at scale. But this is why also strategically, we are very clear on that business, we'll have to be steered on margins and not on volume. So what we have been seeing this business doing is running on a smaller and smaller book and focusing more and more on those customers where we are able then to make a risk-adjusted fair margin if I look at the risk transformation that we're doing for these clients. I don't want to refer and can't refer now to whether that's an industry-wide phenomenon or not. What I can tell you that this is not a one-hit wonder, which has happened now in Q1. It is a development that we have been working for throughout the last 4 years with the continuous effort on managing our customer portfolio in that business.

And Marc, look forward to meeting you in person for your farewell events. So my 2 questions are actually centered around your German networks. So firstly, if I'm not mistaken, you were still awaiting for some more details on the current regulatory period. I was just wondering if you can update if there's been any change on the efficiency factors or anything.

And the second one was looking forward to the next regulatory period, there's obviously a consultation out from the regulator to move to back and reduce the regulatory period. And then there's also the live court case that you have for the current period. So just wondering how you think the negotiations will evolve? And should we assume that if you're successful in the court case, the regulator -- I mean is there quid pro quo between getting a better deal post '29 and leaving some money on the table for existing assets now? Or how would you think of this discussion.

Marc Spieker

So where do we have news and where do we essentially looking at the same time line with no -- is expected no further update. So first of all, what we have seen since the full year results is the publication of the efficiency benchmark. And the good news is that E.ON continues to be very efficient, i.e., 100% efficient operator. And I think that underpins our strategic relevance and the efforts that we are doing and continuously focusing on operational excellence also in our Energy Networks business. There hasn't been a further update on then the general efficiency factor. So -- and that stands on the efficiency front. We have now a public confirmation about what we have been working towards any or as an ambition to be fully efficient and we now need to see how the regulator deals with the general efficiency factor. Still, this has not been published yet.

On the consultation, then for the regulatory period starting 2028 for I guess '29 for power, no update essentially, Deepa that is worth relevant sharing here. I think what we continue to look at, first and foremost, is the proposal by the regulator. How to deal with depreciation schedules for existing gas networks. So this was one of the ideas expressed as part of the consultation paper where the regulator also pronounced that they were seeking there a fast solution. So kind of in the pipeline to expect is then a clarification by the regulator on how they intend to deal with existing gas networks, which is obviously also relevant for the energy transition in total. And for a lot of the market players, as you know for us gas networks has a very small share in our RAB but this is from a regulatory point of view, what we would expect to be the upcoming release. I think that's on the regulatory side.

Court case, also no update. So we haven't seen any -- there hasn't been any specific intervention with the court, no hearing, et cetera. So nothing to update on that side.

Iris Eveleigh

With that, we move on to the questions from Wanda from UBS.

Unidentified Analyst

Marc, all the best, again. Two questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, Energy Retail, you had a very strong start into the year. Q1 EBITDA accounts for 50% of the full year guidance. So do you expect any reversal later this year? Or is there any buffer included in the guidance, something similar to what you did at the end of last year. And if there is any buffer, would you be able to quantify it? And the second question is on the UK Retail. In March [indiscernible] launched a discussion paper for the future of price protection, the [indiscernible] collection is upcoming. How do you see the market structure changing as the current one, the price cut doesn't really work.

Marc Spieker

So 2024 guidance, Wanda. I think what I would stress is that we are back basically in normal operations. So while the last 2 years have been very much affected by energy crisis and kind of the relief from the energy crisis. We are now more or less back in normal mode. And I think where we can take confidence from is how well we have managed the first quarter, which has been extremely mild. And this double-digit -- mid double-digit million euro negative impact from weather for the second warmest quarter during the last 50 years. That is a quite good performance. But it's too early now to say at this stage what that means for the remainder of the year. So for our guidance, take that we are managing towards the midpoint as usually. And at this stage, there's nothing that I would flag where we are particularly aggressive or conservative in the way how we have set our guidance.

And apart from that, you always know that we deliver what we promise. So -- but the midpoint is what it is at this stage. On U.K. retail, there's not a lot that I would share now in this call except for that what we see is that the U.K. regulator has been much more constructive during the last years reacting to the industry's needs. Think we have also seen this -- of generally seen in Europe, the recognition also of retailers of being a system critical part of the energy value chain. And lastly, what I do see that E.ON specifically is being regarded by politicians and regulators as a company that stands in for the interest of customers and is driving the market to the benefit of the customers.

And this gives us also where there are conversations, I think weighted the relevance in being heard in these discussions. And apart from that, it remains what I've said in the past that the U.K. regulation is very little wiggle room now to become worse because if you look at the results, which many of the operators in the U.K. are still achieving, it's not a marketplace where you could now easily just step in as a regulator and believe that U.K. worsening conditions, I think this is still a game about improving conditions to make these operations economically viable.

Iris Eveleigh

With that, next question comes from Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley.

Rob Pulleyn

I have one question, which is quite high level, Marc. And that is, how does E.ON see power demand over time, given, of course, in 2023 it remains significantly lower than we saw precrisis in 2021. Is this structural loss due to industry. What about electrification trends you've spoken about? And also more recently, the data center demand, which we covered on the full year conference call. So I'd love to know what you think is a good suggestion for the medium-term power demand run rate we should be thinking for E.ON from here across the decade.

Marc Spieker

Yes, Rob, it's a very relevant long-term question, but happy to address that. So fundamentally, we are positive about the growth outlook of electricity volumes in our markets. So we expect electricity long term to be on a growth trend. Now when we talk about growth trends in energy, in developed markets, it's never high growth rates, but what we are seeing and expecting is a growth of 1%, 2% annually over time.

And with that, of course, electricity will be the key carrier to replace then a number of primary fuels, specifically, you look at transportation, mineral oil, and if you look at heating mineral oil and gas. So growth outlook for electricity long term. And I think that is also important if you allow me that comment. If you look at the impact on affordability of the energy transition and then you should always keep in mind that all of these investments will be spread over time about much more volumes that will be wheeled in the system and increasingly bidirectional. So increasingly, our customers will also provide their power to the system. And so from that end, we are also confident that this will play out in a decent way.

I have 2 questions, really. So firstly, I wanted to ask about the B2B business. Is this just the U.K. situation? Or this is also visible -- I know you don't have exposure, but this is also visible in the German and Benelux market? And why you saw [indiscernible] exclude the option to participate if there are some opportunities. You see the tender where the margin would be extremely high, why wouldn't you participate if the situation is similar in the continent? And second question I wanted to ask about your retail customer. Where are we in the process of passing through the lower falling commodity cost to the end customer deals. So if I were a customer in Germany, what kind of a reduction can I expect for '25, '26 onwards. And that's the question.

Marc Spieker

Yes. Let me start with the second one, Piotr. So as you know, we are not giving a mid-long-term guidance on price development as we are a business that passes on the fundamental costs onto our customers. What we do see is that what is relevant for our customers, it's the commodity piece and it's the network charges. What we've seen for this year is from this essentially a stable price outlook. We have always different customer segments that will be then adjusted. We also have market-by-market different hedging windows, so the impact of that can be from a timing point of view, a bit different. But essentially, for example, look at Germany, we have seen very little price adjustments this year. And this is on the back of lower commodity prices and somewhat increasing network tariffs.

So all in all at this stage, limited impact. And then we need to see how commodity prices will develop over time but no further guidance as usual on how we see our end customer tariffs then moving. On the B2B business, we had actually been outspoken on that for the last 3, 4 years that we do not regard large industrial and commercial business as a strategically relevant segment for us. And to your question, therefore, in all other markets, we have moved out of that segment. So we are not running I&C retail businesses in any of the other markets. And the U.K. is the only one, and that is due to the specific situation of the Innogy integration and the Npower piece, which we had there, where we first focused on then kind of moving the E.ON and the Innogy business together on one platform.

It is actually from a branding point of view still running on the Npower brand in the U.K. And this is why this is our only material B2B position and hence, no real read across to any other of our markets, at least what would be relevant for us.

Iris Eveleigh

Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, there are no further questions in the round. So I'll take this as a positive that we are delivering what we promised, and we are well on track. If there's anything that comes up after the call, the IR team is always is there to also answer any further questions that may be. With that, yes, I will close today's call.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,Sa Transcripts,0.3490196078431373,453503460,11,https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png,

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Led by lower food and auto prices, inflation in the United States cooled slightly last month after three elevated readings, likely offering a tentative sigh of relief for officials at the Federal Reserve as well as President Joe Biden's re-election team. Consumer prices rose 0.3% from March to April, down slightly from 0.4% the previous month. Measured year-over-year, inflation ticked down from 3.5% to 3.4%.

Retail sales were unchanged in April from March as inflation and interest rates curb spending

NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans unexpectedly paused their spending in April from March as inflation continued to sting and elevated interest rates made taking on debt more burdensome. Retail sales were unchanged, coming in well below economists' expectations, and the figure followed a revised 0.6% pace in March, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday. It rose 0.9% in February. That comes after sales fell 1.1% in January, dragged down in part by inclement weather. Excluding gas prices and auto sales, retail sales fell 0.1%.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and put safeguards around it. The group writes in a report released Wednesday the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The senators say they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward but they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt the stakes were so high.

Billionaire Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to buy TikTok

Billionaire businessman and real estate mogul Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to purchase TikTok's U.S. business. The announcement posted Wednesday on the website of McCourt's Project Liberty initiative adds to the number of investors hoping to benefit from a new federal law that requires TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the popular platform or face a ban. Other investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have expressed a desire to purchase TikTok. However, TikTok's parent company ByteDance has already said it's not planning to sell the platform. The Chinese government is unlikely to approve a sale, especially not one with the recommendation engine that powers the videos that populates users' feeds.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

Stock market today: Wall Street rises toward records after inflation finally slows

NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are rising toward records with hope that inflation is heading back in the right direction. The S&P 500 was 0.9% higher Wednesday and above its all-time high set in March. The Nasdaq composite was adding to its own record and up 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 270 points. A report showing a slowdown in inflation is raising expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. But a stall in spending growth at U.S. retailers is keeping the gains in check. GameStop and other meme stocks are giving up some of their huge gains from the week's start.

Morocco's automotive industry shifts gears to prep for electric vehicle era

TANGIERS, Morocco (AP) -- Morocco has grown its automotive industry from virtually non-existent to Africa's largest in less than two decades. The North African kingdom supplies more cars to Europe than China, India or Japan, and has the capacity to produce 700,000 vehicles a year. Moroccan officials are determined to maintain the country's role as a car-making juggernaut by competing for electric vehicle projects. But whether one of Africa's few industrialization success stories can stay competitive as worldwide auto production transitions to EVs and increasingly relies on automation remains to be seen. Morocco's industry and trade minister says the government is focused on offering more than cheap labor to foreign automakers that are looking for outsourcing destinations.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

The group wrote in a new report released Wednesday that the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The group says they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward, but that they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt that the stakes were so high.

Billionaire Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to buy TikTok

Billionaire businessman and real estate mogul Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to purchase TikTok's U.S. business. The announcement posted Wednesday on the website of McCourt's Project Liberty initiative adds to the number of investors hoping to benefit from a new federal law that requires TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the popular platform or face a ban. Other investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have expressed a desire to purchase TikTok. However, TikTok's parent company ByteDance has already said it's not planning to sell the platform. The Chinese government is unlikely to approve a sale, especially not one with the recommendation engine that powers the videos that populates users' feeds.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

Stock market today: Wall Street rises toward records after inflation finally slows

NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are rising toward records with hope that inflation is heading back in the right direction. The S&P 500 was 0.8% higher Wednesday and above its all-time high set in March. The Nasdaq composite was adding to its own record and up 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 250 points. A report showing a slowdown in inflation is raising expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. But a stall in spending growth at U.S. retailers is keeping the gains in check. GameStop and other meme stocks are giving up some of their huge gains from the week's start.

Morocco's automotive industry shifts gears to prep for electric vehicle era

TANGIERS, Morocco (AP) -- Morocco has grown its automotive industry from virtually non-existent to Africa's largest in less than two decades. The North African kingdom supplies more cars to Europe than China, India or Japan, and has the capacity to produce 700,000 vehicles a year. Moroccan officials are determined to maintain the country's role as a car-making juggernaut by competing for electric vehicle projects. But whether one of Africa's few industrialization success stories can stay competitive as worldwide auto production transitions to EVs and increasingly relies on automation remains to be seen. Morocco's industry and trade minister says the government is focused on offering more than cheap labor to foreign automakers that are looking for outsourcing destinations.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

Retail sales were unchanged in April from March as inflation and interest rates curb spending

NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans unexpectedly paused their spending in April from March as inflation continued to sting and elevated interest rates made taking on debt more burdensome. Retail sales were unchanged, coming in well below economists' expectations, and the figure followed a revised 0.6% pace in March, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday. It rose 0.9% in February. That comes after sales fell 1.1% in January, dragged down in part by inclement weather. Excluding gas prices and auto sales, retail sales fell 0.1%.

May 13 (Interfax) - The European gas market has replaced most of the Russian gas it used to receive with U.S. liquefied natural gas, but Europe has also been saved by extraordinarily mild winters, lower gas consumption by industry and increased use of renewable energy. However, European gas analysts believe the crisis is now over, and, faced by reduced supply flexibility and a recovery in consumption, infrastructure constraints and competition from Asia for LNG, as well as uncertainty over the continued transit of Russian gas through Ukraine, every cubic meter of gas could count in the event of a cold winter.

Cara MacDonald, head of LNG & Clean-Fuel Supply and Origination at RWE AG, said at the Flame gas conference at the end of April that Europe had been able to withstand the past two heating seasons thanks to mild weather and a demand side response. ""Europe had much milder weather, especially in the winter of 2022-2023, which cooled consumption and allowed storage to fill up. Additionally, due to high gas prices, we have seen demand destruction in Europe, while in Asia, this meant more fuel switching,"" she said.

""But is the crisis over? Things could change in the coming winters, especially if there is no flexibility in LNG supplies. The only answer may be continued demand side response,"" MacDonald said, although she believes this might not save the situation.

""Yes, we coped by reducing demand, but can we do it again? When I look at demand side signals, I see that the market will become tighter,"" she said, adding that there was limited supply flexibility and any incident at an LNG plant could tighten the balance.

Glenn Vinvand Kviljo, head of trading at Equinor, also said the European market faced uncertainty in the coming winter after two mild winters: ""Will there be another mild winter, or we will get back to the normal, cold winter? We cannot sit back and relax,"" he said.

Chief analyst at Uniper Energy, Gregor Pett, warned that despite the fact that the market has been more bearish in recent weeks and months, this was mainly associated with a weak economy, air temperatures, high storage and others. ""But for most market participants, this is a fragile balance, and at any time the situation can turn around [...] and there could be a repeat of the crisis. It's not over, it's far from over,"" he said.

""It is difficult to foresee what will happen in terms of supply and demand. It depends on many things, including the weather. We can have a very mild winter, so gas demand in Europe will be low. If it's an extremely cold winter the demand will be higher than in the past two years and a lower supply could be a problem,"" a representative of a European gas trader told Interfax in an interview.

""If there was an outage of the production from Norway or hurricanes in the U.S. - there are many events which can happen and which can bring to a very tight situation in Europe where each Bcm of supply is important,"" the trader said, adding that a very hot summer could also cause demand to spike.

He said that current gas prices in Europe include a risk premium since all these factors were difficult to predict. ""And each player has an own opinion if prices are fair or not. Currently the market is pricing in, I would say, a normal cold winter, but the winter can be different,"" the trader said.

Europe has reduced gas consumption by about 20% over the past two years to approximately 330 billion cubic meters due to high gas prices (27 EU countries), as well as the energy transition drive, while some industrial demand for gas has been lost forever, some participants believe. However, there are signs of demand recovering.

Cheniere Energy said in a presentation that gas consumption in Europe was now below the 2017-2021 average. It fell 19% in the region's six biggest economies, with consumption in industry down 22% (between 18% and 23%), in energy - 14% (between 8% and 25%), in other sectors - 21% (between 17% and 28%).

Uniper Energy's Pett said Europe has lost a very large amount of industrial production due to high prices, but ""we expect a lot of industrial demand to return to the market."" However, most gas analysts were unable to say to what extent demand might return.

Gautam Mukherjee, head of gas analytics at BP, said it was necessary to look at sectors. For example, in industry, gas is being replaced by heat pumps; in the energy sector, on the one hand, there is more renewable energy, but on the other hand, coal is being replaced. Overall, he said, Europe has had very weak economic results over the past two years, so not only has demand for gas fallen, but demand for electricity has also been very low. And Europe's economy is expected to recover in the coming years, so demand for gas in both the power industry and other industry will increase.

Uniper Energy's Pett said the difference in consumption in a mild and normal winter for northwestern Europe was 30 billion cubic meters, and last winter was ""extraordinarily mild.""

Given the demand and uncertainty over the weather, gas market participants are concerned about whether the contract for Russian gas transit through Ukraine will be extended, and if not, whether LNG can replace it. Europe has lost over 100 billion cubic meters of pipeline gas supplies from Russia over the past two years, but supplies through Ukraine and TurkStream continue to some extent.

Andrei Prokofiev, head of Division for Cooperation with Clients at Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU), said that both the transit deal and the agreement between Gazprom and GTSOU would expire at the end of the year. ""As the Ukrainian authorities and European Commission have said many times, Ukraine is not going to negotiate with Russia on this matter - no direct agreements. What does this mean from a practical point of view? Not having an agreement between operators means we'll not be putting any capacity up for at auction,"" he said.

""This is like the situation on our border with Romania, where we have interconnectors - Tekovo, Mediesu Aurit. ""There is infrastructure, a tariff, but we cannot come to an agreement with the Romanian TSO due to technical problems. And neither we nor Romania are offering capacity,"" Prokofiev said.

Last year, Europe bought about 135 bcm of LNG, almost half of it from the United States. However, industry participants say that there will be a limited supply of LNG on the market in 2024-2026. Marco Saalfrank, head of trading for continental Europe at Axpo, estimates that the market will be tight in Europe in 2026-2027 because Europe will need to pay high prices to attract LNG. In addition, there will be high volatility in the market because Europe has lost its flexibility (for supply), he said.

There is an opinion that higher gas prices for Europe will become a new reality. Andrew Walker of Cheniere Marketing said that Europe, as the largest market for US LNG exports, has not traditionally been tied to spot prices in Asia, where the market is tight, as it relies on pipeline supplies. However, now Europe is more tied to Asian prices. ""So now this is a bit of a new reality for Europe, so Europe will probably have to get used to higher prices,"" he said.

Patrick Dugas, head of LNG trading at TotalEnergies, said that before the conflict in Ukraine, Europe was a balancing market where any cargo could find a home. However, then the paradigm changed, and Europe became a premium market like Asia. ""I think in the coming months and years we will see competition for LNG between the two basins, European and Asian,"" he said.

Dugas also said that the European market has become characterized by volatility and uncertainty. ""Every time there is a supply problem, it creates volatility in the market [...] and to solve these two problems, we need flexibility,"" he said.

The TotalEnergies trader said not to forget about the recovery in China, which imported 20 million tonnes of LNG in the first quarter, which is 4 million tonnes more than the previous year. ""So recovery in demand in China and possibly Europe will be the two main themes in the market over the next few years,"" he said.

""There really is a maximum amount of LNG on the market now. And if there is no increase in supply with growing demand in Asia, Europe will not be able to fill the balance with liquefied natural gas,"" a spokesperson from RWE said.

However, LNG sellers need assurances that their products will be in demand in the long term. Landon Larson, marketing director for American LNG producer Sempra Infrastructure, said that European companies are now buying LNG, but Europe has announced decarbonization goals, and this puts pressure on investment decisions for the second wave of LNG projects, raising questions about whether or not the projects will be able to sell their LNG, and about their financial sustainability. At the same time, many believe that Europe has set unrealistic goals for its energy transition, at least where timing is concerned.

Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has already suspended the issuance of new licenses for LNG exports, intending to assess the extent to which Europe is focused on LNG purchases, or if it will still move away from using fossil fuels.

Axpo's Saalfrank said that there are risks in signing long-term contracts. Therefore, Europe is going to reduce gas consumption; in addition, one cannot exclude ""the risk that Russian gas will return to the European market in 10-20 years,"" he said.

Another risk relates to price: gas purchases tied to oil or linked to Henry Hub spot pricing is sold at a TTF price in Europe, so such price risks are not easily hedged in long-term contracts. In addition, the trader said, there is a regulatory risk (on carbon regulation). ""So, 3-4 years ago, Ireland and France refused to buy American LNG because it is produced in shale deposits,"" he said.

Nicola Duffin, head of LNG supply at Ineos Energy Trading, said that Ineos had the advantage of being a private company and is not under pressure from shareholders to divest from fossil fuels. ""We are realistic and understand that we will need gas for the next 20 years. Other companies may agree with this, but they are not allowed to,"" she noted. In order to enter into a long-term agreement for the purchase of LNG, you need to be ""relatively large and have a huge amount of money,"" Duffin said. It is difficult for small companies to operate in the LNG market.

Gulfstream LNG CEO Vivek Chandra said that traders help grow the LNG business by becoming intermediaries, for example, with countries like Sri Lanka that cannot enter into long-term contracts. Asia, especially China and India, are much more active in purchasing LNG, as they consider it a transition fuel, he said. In addition, we should not forget about the Middle East; for example, Kuwait has become an active buyer, as well as African countries.

But infrastructure is no less of a risk. Laurent Hamou of Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) said the gas infrastructure utilization in Europe has been at record levels over the past two years and this means that ""in the coming years we cannot afford any disruptions. Any problem will be very noticeable, and we have a limited number of suppliers and less flexibility.""

""Everyone says that everything is fine - there's spare capacity at LNG terminals in Europe. But I believe that, on the contrary, we need to increase capacity and give the market more flexibility. Let's see what happens in the next two years. Our contract for gas through Ukraine might come to an end, there might be some recovery in demand, and I'm sure we'll need more LNG terminals,"" he said.

Hamou said there was a regional discrepancy in Europe in this regard - for example, Spanish terminals were operating at normal levels, while infrastructure in south-eastern Europe, for example, the terminal in Greece, as well as infrastructure in Germany, were operating at a totally unusual level.

Halting gas transit through Ukraine will result in even bigger restrictions, but we need to think about all European consumers. ""If French consumers paid the German price for gas like in 2022, they would be paying 5 billion euros more. This is a lot of money. You need geographical flexibility, time flexibility and supply flexibility. Any accident will affect prices,"" Hamou said.

Hungary is heavily reliant on Ukrainian transit. ""Yes, some new infrastructure is being built, but it is not yet clear how it will work. There is a lot of infrastructure in the north and south, but gas needs to be delivered to the center,"" he said.

Thomas Thorkildsen, chief commercial officer at Hoegh LNG, in his presentation cited the degree of exposure of some European countries to Russian gas. Croatia gets 81% of its gas from Russia (1.4 bcm), Austria - 75% (5.6 bcm), Hungary - 62% (6.2 bcm), Slovakia - 57% (2.4 bcm), Serbia - 61% (2.1 bcm) Greece - 39% (2 bcm) and the Czech Republic - 35% (2.6 bcm).

Half of this gas enters the EU through Ukraine, the transit agreement ends at the end of 2024, and this must be borne in mind, he said.

A trader at Hungary's MVM CEEnergy told Interfax that the company was now buying 10-11 LNG cargoes, equivalent to 1 bcm of gas, at the Krk terminal in Croatia. The capacity booking contract is valid until 2027, and the company plans to bid at auctions for new capacity. But any increase in purchases will depend how LNG competes with pipeline supplies. Hungary is also counting on potentially higher production within the EU, in particular the Neptun project offshore Romania, which ExxonMobil could put on line in 2026-2027.

But the MVM CEEnergy trader said that although there is enough regasification capacity, pipeline tariffs across Europe might be too high to justify buying LNG.

GTSOU's Prokofiev echoed this. He said European markets were highly segmented and it was difficult to transport LNG from Greece to Slovakia, Austria or Germany. The issue of capacity can be resolved, for example, there is capacity in Ukraine. ""But due to the tariff policies of some countries, this sometimes does not make economic sense. For example, the cost of storage in Germany, likewise in Austria, the anticipated increase in tariffs in Slovakia, make the problem more difficult. And this needs to be resolved, at least at the government level,"" he said, adding that since everyone protected their own market, perhaps a decision at the level of the European Commission is needed.

Prokofiev also said that last year about 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas were pumped into Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities by non-residents and another 0.6-0.7 bcm remained there. At the same time, the capacity of Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities is more than 10 bcm, which could cover a potential interruption of gas supplies to Europe.

Market participants believe that even more LNG terminals need to be built. Ineos Energy Trading's Duffin said Europe needed a huge amount of imported capacity by 2028. She said Northwestern Europe, under normal weather conditions, would have to import an additional 46 bcm of gas as LNG - demand is growing due to the switch from coal to gas, and internal production is falling.

But demand might also fall, so it might make more sense to use floating storage regasification units. But Duffin said it should be remembered that FSRUs are more expensive, do not last forever and they do not have operational flexibility. ""So if governments put an end to subsidies and companies stop paying, they will go to other countries where they are needed more quickly. And I see that in Europe people soon forgot about this and are perhaps not taking it as seriously as they should,"" she said.

Hoegh LNG's Thorkildsen said the company currently owned 10 FSRUs, and a further three LNG tankers that can be converted into FSRUs, which usually takes up to 18 months, but there have been precedents where this happened within five months. He said a new FSRU costs about $500 million and that all shipyards were now booked until 2028.

Hoegh LNG estimates that in 2022 the order for new LNG vessels broke all records and amounted to 145 units, with 68 in 2023 and 44 tankers in 2024. At the same time, 10 gas carriers have already been built in 2024, another 60 are expected, with plans to build 86 tankers in 2025, 84 in 2026, 73 in 2027 and 26 in 2028.The LNG fleet is currently about 600 tankers, excluding FSRUs, which are mainly used as terminals.

The company's FSRUs operate under long-term contracts - half of them in Europe (three in Germany and one in each of France and Lithuania). But Thorkildsen said China was the only market that plans to increase regasification capacity to 200 bcm from the current 100 bcm. Other growing markets, such as Italy, Malaysia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Bangladesh, where LNG demand is forecast to grow, are not making decisions to build regasification facilities.

He said Germany was the exception among European countries. But given the announced growth in imports and planned commissioning of regasification capacities, their utilization will reach 63% in 2025-2028 and 82% by 2029, which corresponds to the situation with capacity utilization in north-west Europe in 2022, when there was chaos and high prices. Utilization of LNG terminals in Germany will exceed 90% after 2030, reaching 95% in 2033.

In Italy it is even worse - utilization of its regasification capacity will reach 94% in 2024, and this will no longer be enough from 2027, given the planned import of LNG. ""This doesn't look like energy security,"" Thorkildsen said.

According to Hoegh LNG, 40% of gas consumed in Europe in 2024 will be LNG - about 175 bcm of approximately 420 bcm consumed, while 119 bcm will be supplied by gas pipelines from Norway, 22 bcm by the gas pipeline from Russia, and 67 bcm will be produced in the EU and the UK.

A drop in Russian gas supplies is expected after 2024 as the transit contract with Ukraine expire; supplies from North Africa and Azerbaijan will remain largely at the same level; imports from Norway will decrease from 108 bcm in 2029 to 81 bcm in 2034 and 58 bcm in 2039; and Europe's own production will decrease to 60 bcm.

LNG supplies are expected to increase initially to 203 bcm in 2029, accounting for half of consumption, but as consumption falls to approximately 330 bcm in 2039, LNG purchases will also fall, to 157 bcm, Hoegh LNG says in its presentation.

The European Union is currently discussing a ban on imports of Russian LNG. Last year, Europe purchased about 18 bcm of LNG from Russia, with about 1 bcm of this redirected to Asian markets.

However, market participants believe European politicians will most likely postpone the embargo until 2027, when new LNG projects go on line for world markets.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.1058823529411764,453481330,1,,eng-9563546

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Led by lower food and auto prices, inflation in the United States cooled slightly last month after three elevated readings, likely offering a tentative sigh of relief for officials at the Federal Reserve as well as President Joe Biden's re-election team. Consumer prices rose 0.3% from March to April, down slightly from 0.4% the previous month. Measured year-over-year, inflation ticked down from 3.5% to 3.4%.

Retail sales were unchanged in April from March as inflation and interest rates curb spending

NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans unexpectedly paused their spending in April from March as inflation continued to sting and elevated interest rates made taking on debt more burdensome. Retail sales were unchanged, coming in well below economists' expectations, and the figure followed a revised 0.6% pace in March, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday. It rose 0.9% in February. That comes after sales fell 1.1% in January, dragged down in part by inclement weather. Excluding gas prices and auto sales, retail sales fell 0.1%.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and also put safeguards around it. The group wrote in a new report released Wednesday that the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The group says they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward, but that they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt that the stakes were so high.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

Billionaire Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to buy TikTok

Billionaire businessman and real estate mogul Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to purchase TikTok's U.S. business. The announcement posted Wednesday on the website of McCourt's Project Liberty initiative adds to the number of investors hoping to benefit from a new federal law that requires TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the popular platform or face a ban. Other investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have expressed a desire to purchase TikTok. However, TikTok's parent company ByteDance has already said it's not planning to sell the platform. The Chinese government is unlikely to approve a sale, especially not one with the recommendation engine that powers the videos that populates users' feeds.

Stock market today: S&P 500 heads toward a record after inflation finally slows

NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are rising toward records with hope that inflation is finally heading back in the right direction. The S&P 500 was 0.6% higher Wednesday and on track to beat its all-time high set in March. The Nasdaq composite was adding to its own record and up 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 206 points. A report showing a slowdown in inflation is raising expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate this year, pushing Treasury yields lower. But a stall in spending by U.S. households tired after years of high inflation is keeping the gains in check.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

Slovakia plans to build a new nuclear reactor

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) -- Slovakia's government approved a plan to build another nuclear reactor in a country that relies heavily on nuclear electricity generation. The government said Wednesday that a new reactor, with an expected output of 1,200 megawatts, is to be built at the Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear plant, where the utility Slovenske Elektrarne currently operates two nuclear units. Slovakia generates over 50% of its electricity at two nuclear plants. The decision reflects recent nuclear expansion in Central and Eastern Europe, where the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are also planning new reactors.

Meme stocks are roaring again. This time may be different

NEW YORK (AP) -- GameStop and other meme stocks are roaring once again, surging to dizzying heights suddenly and sharply.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's perhaps the biggest question swirling around the U.S. economy right now: Is inflation stuck at an elevated level -- or will last year's steady decline resume sometime soon? On Wednesday, the government will issue the latest monthly inflation report, a set of figures that will be scrutinized by economists, Wall Street traders and Federal Reserve officials for any insight into that question. Analysts estimate that year-over-year inflation dipped from 3.5% in March to 3.4% in April. Measured from March to April, consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.4%, the same as in the previous month.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and also put safeguards around it. The group wrote in a new report released Wednesday that the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The group says they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward, but that they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt that the stakes were so high.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

Stock market today: Global markets follow Wall Street higher ahead of key inflation update

HONG KONG (AP) -- World stocks have advanced after a rally on Wall Street took the Nasdaq composite to a record high. U.S. futures were lower while oil prices gained. Markets in Hong Kong and Seoul were closed for holidays. Investors were reviewing a mixed report on inflation and awaiting an even more important update on consumer prices later Wednesday. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.5% and was just shy of its own all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.8%. Treasury yields edged lower in the bond market following the mixed report on wholesale inflation.

Wholesale price increases accelerated in April as inflation remains sticky

WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. wholesale prices rose sharply last month, a sign that stubbornly high inflation may persist after three elevated readings in consumer prices to start the year. The Labor Department said Tuesday that its producer price index -- which tracks price changes before they reach consumers -- climbed 0.5% from March to April, after it dipped 0.1% the previous month. Measured year over year, producer prices rose by 2.2% in April, up from 1.8% in March and the biggest increase in a year.

Fed's Powell downplays potential for a rate hike despite higher price pressures

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the central bank is unlikely to raise its key interest rate in response to signs of stubborn inflation and underscored his view that price increases would soon start to cool again. Yet Powell, during a panel discussion in Amsterdam, said his confidence that inflation will ease ""is not as high as it was"" because price increases have been persistently hot in the first three months of this year. Powell stressed that the Fed's preferred approach was to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak rather than increase it.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

Stock market today: Global markets follow Wall Street higher ahead of key inflation update

HONG KONG (AP) -- World stocks have advanced after a rally on Wall Street took the Nasdaq composite to a record high. U.S. futures were lower while oil prices gained. Markets in Hong Kong and Seoul were closed for holidays. Investors were reviewing a mixed report on inflation and awaiting an even more important update on consumer prices later Wednesday. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.5% and was just shy of its own all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.8%. Treasury yields edged lower in the bond market following the mixed report on wholesale inflation.

Slovakia plans to build a new nuclear reactor

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) -- Slovakia's government approved a plan to build another nuclear reactor in a country that relies heavily on nuclear electricity generation. The government said Wednesday that a new reactor, with an expected output of 1,200 megawatts, is to be built at the Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear plant, where the utility Slovenske Elektrarne currently operates two nuclear units. Slovakia generates over 50% of its electricity at two nuclear plants. The decision reflects recent nuclear expansion in Central and Eastern Europe, where the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are also planning new reactors.

Wholesale price increases accelerated in April as inflation remains sticky

WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. wholesale prices rose sharply last month, a sign that stubbornly high inflation may persist after three elevated readings in consumer prices to start the year. The Labor Department said Tuesday that its producer price index -- which tracks price changes before they reach consumers -- climbed 0.5% from March to April, after it dipped 0.1% the previous month. Measured year over year, producer prices rose by 2.2% in April, up from 1.8% in March and the biggest increase in a year.

Fed's Powell downplays potential for a rate hike despite higher price pressures

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the central bank is unlikely to raise its key interest rate in response to signs of stubborn inflation and underscored his view that price increases would soon start to cool again. Yet Powell, during a panel discussion in Amsterdam, said his confidence that inflation will ease ""is not as high as it was"" because price increases have been persistently hot in the first three months of this year. Powell stressed that the Fed's preferred approach was to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak rather than increase it.

Meme stocks are roaring again. This time may be different

NEW YORK (AP) -- GameStop and other meme stocks are roaring once again, surging to dizzying heights suddenly and sharply. Some things are different this time around versus the initial supernova for meme stocks that shocked Wall Street in 2021. The biggest change is it that it all feels a bit familiar now. Experts say that experience, plus some changes in the market, should allow Wall Street to more easily digest the sharp movements. But some things remain firmly the same. Chief among them is the risk of losing everything that accompanies the potential to make fast money playing such volatile stocks.",register-herald.com,news,Beckley Register-Herald,Associated Press,-0.01960784313725494,453467259,7,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b87268c4-7873-11e7-af9a-f3a04545878a.jpg?resize=200%2C200,eng-9567015

Strong today - Strong tomorrow.

Our BMW way into the future

Dear Shareholders!

A warm welcome from BMW Welt in Munich. A lot of people talk about the

transformation of mobility and the automotive industry - how one will

replace the other. At BMW, we do things a little differently. We call it:

continuous progress.

Becoming a little bit better every day - that is what we aspire to. And what

I, myself, am measured against. Never being satisfied with the status quo

brings us closer to our ambitious goals. Step by step. Or, more fittingly,

when talking about cars: mile by mile. That may sound very grounded and

methodical, but it certainly yields highly effective results.

We always look to the future. That is part of BMW's vast array of

experience. It gives us strength and empowers us, time and again, to take

bold action: We know what we are capable of! That is why BMW is still here

after 108 years.

our global team. Together, we bring our combined know-how to the roads

- in a very literal sense. There are currently more than 150,000 of us

worldwide - representing nearly every nationality there is, united by the

BMW Spirit. In autumn of last year, we surveyed all our associates around

the world: 85 percent said they fully support the company's goals and

strategy. And even 93 percent are proud to work for the BMW Group.

What a boost for us!

104th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 15th May 2024

We are mobilising them all for the next massive leap, because your

company is once again reinventing itself - at precisely the right time.

You, too, my dear shareholders, are part of our BMW team. Your support

for our direction gives us the momentum and latitude we need to make

decisions with a long-term perspective. This traces back to legendary

entrepreneur Herbert Quandt. What a legacy! The next generation is

carrying forward that legacy - much like we do at the company.

We always base our strategic decisions on facts and informed analysis.

This certainly requires experience and, sometimes, plain common sense, as

well. This makes your company robust and ensures that we remain

composed in a turbulent environment. All of this comes together in the

BMW way. This approach guarantees that the following always holds true

for your company:

""Strong today - strong tomorrow"".

For financial year 2023: Should you approve our proposed dividend, you

will receive a payout equivalent to 33.7 percent of our unappropriated

profit. During the financial year, we had revised our guidance upwards. At

year-end we met all our targets. We posted solid growth in sales, reaching

a new all-time high of more than 2.55 million vehicles. In fact, we are the

only German OEM to have regained our pre-pandemic level.

Our Group EBT margin of 11 percent came in higher than our strategic

target of 10 percent. We are consistently performing at a high level, as

confirmed by our EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment, which has been

within our defined target range of eight to ten percent for the past nine

quarters, including the first quarter of 2024.

This allows us to continue to make substantial investments.

Our capital expenditure, as well as our research and development

spending, will peak this year. We will once again be making major

investments - because our actions are always geared towards the future.

Individual mobility offers tremendous potential for profitable growth and

gaining market share.

Statement, Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG

104th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 15th May 2024

Today, let's take a look at how we continue to forge our BMW way -

in four chapters.

Future to the max: Turning visions into reality.

Following our own convictions: Technology openness is effective.

Global success today means acting regionally.

The car as digital companion: We are making mobility more

human, more intelligent and more sustainable.

These focal points also shed light on the topics you requested through the

shareholder portal.

Turning visions into reality.

This is the first topic I would like to talk about today.

What you see right here is nothing less than the future: pure BMW - taken

to a whole new level. This is where all the big topics of future mobility come

together: Electric. Fully digitalised. Sustainable.

For now, they are still Vision Vehicles - but they will be on the roads in a

very similar form very soon. Last year, I promised you a new Vision Vehicle,

which we then unveiled at the IAA MOBILITY. The BMW Vision Neue

Klasse celebrated its premiere here in Munich. You'll see right away that it's

a sporty sedan.

No other car at the IAA received as much media coverage and positive

feedback - which is just one more reason to bring along another highlight

for you today: The BMW Vision Neue Klasse X - a car that very clearly

reimagines the BMW X philosophy in a totally new way.

Both vehicles will compete in high-volume segments - because we want

our innovations to have a broad impact, not just in niche segments. Both

vehicles underline that the NEUE KLASSE is consistent and broad at the

same time.

Consistent - in terms of design, technology and sustainability. Broad - with

respect to the other models that will follow.

Statement, Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG

104th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 15th May 2024

These are the two bookends of the NEUE KLASSE - with lots of room inbetween that we intend to exploit. And we deliver on our promises:

Within 24 months of the start of production, there will be at least six

different models on the market.

Our industry has never seen speed quite like this before - but if anyone can

do it, then it's us at BMW. We are picking up the pace on a massive scale.

Our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, will lead the way, with the launch of

the first X model in late 2025. This will continue seamlessly in 2026 with

the Sedan at our main plant in Munich, as well as Plant Shenyang in China.

In 2027, the NEUE KLASSE will also ramp up in San Luis Potosí, Mexico.

Our customers ask: How far can I drive on electric power? How quickly can I

charge my car?

We are able to tell them: at least 30 percent farther and 30 percent faster.

In practice, this means that: It only takes ten minutes to charge your car for

a 300-kilometre trip - hardly enough time to grab a coffee!

This is possible thanks to the new sixth-generation round cells. We are

using them for the first time in the NEUE KLASSE - which means you can

look forward to an even higher-level ""BMW driving experience"".

What might look like a Playstation is actually four super-brains, each

integrating several highly intelligent control units. This opens up new

possibilities - from powertrain and driving dynamics, to automated driving,

to how we interact with our cars.

The most important aspect for our customers is: What does the NEUE

KLASSE feel like on the road? The Board of Management already had the

chance to drive the pre-series - and, believe me, it gave us goosebumps.

The magnitude of the technological wave we are unleashing becomes even

clearer when you realise:

The innovations of the NEUE KLASSE will be incorporated into all BMW

models in the coming years, regardless of their drive technology. In simple

terms: Soon, all BMW technology will be NEUE KLASSE. The NEUE

104th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 15th May 2024

KLASSE is set to become our innovation and technology booster for all

future areas of activity, including design.

We aren't just taking mobility to a new level; the BMW Group is also

becoming a NEW company. I believe this is entirely in your interest as our

shareholders.

My second topic for today reflects our belief in the effectiveness of

technology openness.

The heart of the NEUE KLASSE is electric - running on its own, new

architecture. If demand for electric vehicles continues to grow as forecast,

we will be able to leverage corresponding economies of scale.

But the world is a big place - which is why we continue to serve all markets

with premium products. With us, everyone can find the right drivetrain to

suit their needs. Anything else would be unwise from a business

perspective.

Using technology clusters and modules enables us to be highly flexible.

Think of it like this: We can roll out innovations and technological advances

across all architectures and segments, and scale them efficiently.

We don't distinguish between ""old"" and ""new"" vehicles - instead, we

deliver cutting-edge technology across all areas. And, moreover, we offer

the best overall package. This is what we aspire to - and it is perhaps the

underlying secret of your company's success.

Let me give you a current example: Following on from the new BMW 5

Series Sedan, the new BMW 5 Series Touring also comes in four drive

technologies. The BMW i5* is all-electric, with an impressive everyday

range of over 500 kilometres.

Plug-in hybrids also remain extremely popular. For the new BMW 5 Series,

the PHEV variant could account for about 20 percent of our sales in Europe.

This shows we are right on track with our ten attractive PHEV models. And

of course, the new 5 Series is also well received as a highly efficient

combustion engine.

Statement, Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG

104th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 15th May 2024

Focused technology openness is not something that is achieved overnight.

You know my position: Building cars is a highly complex task. New market

players are realising this too.

It is a strength of your company - and I believe it is also a unique selling

point: The ability to master this complexity, seamlessly, and to effectively

orchestrate, scale and further develop technologies.

Our sales figures confirm this: BMW is maintaining its leading position in

the global premium segment. Our strongest growth last year came from the

upper premium and luxury class, as well as our all-electric models, or BEVs

for short. We delivered over 375,000 BEVs to customers in 2023 - an

increase of almost 75 percent over the previous year.

This dynamism is also reflected in our share of the global BEV market: At

4.1 percent, it is already significantly higher than our share of the total

global market, which remains stable at 3.3 percent.

Demand for BEVs will continue to climb - although not in a linear fashion; it

will be dynamic and market-specific. We reiterate this time and again - and

it holds true in multiple markets.

We see e-mobility as the fastest-growing drive technology - today and in

the future. By 2030, all-electric vehicles should account for about half of

our deliveries. We remain committed to this goal and are steering the rampup in line with demand. We will stay flexible - even well into the 2030s.

We are aligning our strategic planning accordingly - and enabling our

architectures. In this way, we can respond quickly at all times. More than

15 BEV models will be available this year across all BMW Group brands.

Here, you can see the MINI Aceman*.

In April, it celebrated its world premiere at AUTO CHINA. The Aceman is

offered exclusively as a all-electric vehicle.

It fills the gap between the Cooper* and the Countryman*, which has now

grown significantly in size. The new Cooper is already sold out - at least for

the next four months. The only thing missing is the new MINI Convertible,

which will be released in the second half of the year.

Together, these models form the NEW MINI Family, which is effectively the

counterpart to the NEUE KLASSE at BMW: MINI's leap into the future.

And: We produce the New MINI Family worldwide: at our Spotlight joint

venture in China; in Oxford, in the UK; and, for the first time, also in

Germany, at Plant Leipzig.

We talked about bookends earlier. Now, with our brands, let's jump from

MINI go-kart feeling to our luxury brand, Rolls-Royce. Spectre* certainly hit

the ground running. What a phenomenal start!

In the first quarter of this year, this model alone accounted for 38 percent of

Rolls-Royce deliveries. That is how we do e-mobility in the luxury class.

Spectre glides along effortlessly, like a flying carpet. Our luxury brand's

vehicles have never been as compelling and as differentiated as they are

today. And let's not forget that they also earn a significant contribution

margin for the company.

BMW Motorrad is also reporting profitable growth, having celebrated its

centenary in September. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz attended the

anniversary celebrations at Plant Berlin-Spandau.

We shared two major milestones with him:

First, the inauguration of the new ""BMW Motorrad Welt"". What BMW Welt

in Munich is to cars, we now also have in Berlin for our two-wheeled

vehicles. Second, the world premiere of the R 1300 GS. Many people -

myself included, as a motorcycle enthusiast - have been eagerly awaiting

the next-generation GS. The trade press was practically euphoric about it.

For those who prefer an electric ride in the city, BMW Motorrad's second

electric model, the CE 02, is perfect.

Our core BMW brand also has a slew of upcoming, exciting vehicles, with

14 launches and numerous model variants this year alone.

The BMW 1 Series will be released onto the market in the compact class.

And we will launch the new BMW X3 - one of our most popular models

overall. The new X3 will be available with a highly-efficient combustion

engine and as a plug-in hybrid variant.

We recently presented our new and future vehicles to our retailers,

including 1,500 retailers from all over Europe in Amsterdam. We did the

same in Las Vegas for over 1,000 dealers from the Americas region. I got

the sense at both events that our retailers are genuinely excited about what

is to come.

Especially for Europe, I have to stress: The retailers will remain by our side

in the new sales system - that won't change. We are already using direct

sales for MINI in China and reporting positive experiences in the first

European countries. We will be transitioning the BMW brand to the new

direct and fully digitalized sales model in Europe from 2026, as planned.

You, our shareholders, also wanted to know:

How are we progressing with hydrogen?

Our BMW iX5 Hydrogen* is currently on a world tour, undergoing real-life

testing. It is very well received, everywhere it goes. Our pilot fleet is raising

awareness of hydrogen's role in the energy transition - both for mobility

and across industries. You rightly expect us to meet the European Union's

CO2 requirements.

In 2023, the BMW Group significantly outperformed the CO2 fleet limit set

for us by the EU by more than 20 percent. This year, we expect to see

another slight reduction, with all brands and drivetrain variants

contributing.

Technology-centric, with a clear focus on e-mobility - we are always

consistent in our actions: This is how we are reshaping perception of your

company.

What the New York Times writes is precisely researched.

104th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 15th May 2024

In March, the New York Times praised our drivetrain strategy as far-sighted

and consistent. It described BMW as a ""winner in electric vehicles"" - and

Tesla's only serious competitor. We can certainly live with that. People

expect us to consider things carefully and come up with practical solutions

- because we consistently demonstrate our ability to do so.

In part three, I'll look at the reasons for our global success - which, now,

more than ever, requires us to act regionally. If you look closely, your

company stands out as one of the automotive industry's few ""truly"" global

manufacturers.

Something like this has to grow systematically - and we have been

expanding our footprint for this purpose over the decades.

Let me give you three examples:

China - our biggest single market; Europe - our most important sales

region; the US - our ""second home"":

First: China, where we employ about a fifth of our workforce. It is - after

Germany - our second-largest R&D location. BMW enjoys a high level of

trust there - and not just among our own customers. We are highly

regarded as a company, because we enter into serious, long-term

commitments.

This year, we are celebrating 30 years ""at home in China"" and more than

two decades of commitment in Shenyang.

In April, we signed a new investment agreement with Liaoning Province,

worth 20 billion renminbi or 2.5 billion euros. The Shenyang production site

of our BBA joint venture is transforming into a BMW iFACTORY.

Also in April, I was part of German Chancellor Scholz's economic delegation

to China. Shortly after that, I was in Beijing at AUTO CHINA, where Prime

Minister Li Qiang visited precisely one non-Chinese manufacturer - and

that was the BMW Group.

A phrase I hear a lot in China is ""China speed"". This is a dynamic country -

and we are picking up the pace to keep up: Just last week, our six-millionth

vehicle produced in Shenyang since 2003 rolled off the assembly line. We

only reached the five million mark about a year earlier. This means we

turned out one million vehicles in just 15 months - that is true ""China

speed"".

Second: Europe.

We sell nearly a third of all our vehicles in the European Union, where we

operate ten plants and maintain a broad supplier base. We all benefit from

a united Europe - every single day - and should channel all our collective

efforts into preserving it.

BMW maintains a global outlook. This is something the chair of the General

Works Council and I have reiterated. We urge our associates to pay close

attention whenever seemingly simple solutions are proposed for

complicated issues.

Enjoying democracy means living democracy - and that includes

participation, exercising your right to vote and raising your voice to stand

up for democracy. That is why we have asked everyone to vote on June 9.

What applies to Europe, applies even more to Germany: We need the best

minds - and the smartest minds think very carefully about where they want

to go. That is why we support the ""We stand for values"" initiative.

In Germany, we have many debates about emotionally charged trigger

points. There is broad consensus on meta-topics. This is how sociologist

Steffen Mau describes it. His latest study comes to the conclusion: We are

not a divided society.

As a result, we shouldn't speak ill of our country and Germany as a

location, but leverage our potential. I can only agree with that.

Third: the USA.

We refer to the US as our ""second home"". Next year will be our 50th year in

the United States.

In 2023, your company was once again one of the largest net exporters of

vehicles from the US by value. Germany is the only place where we have a

higher purchasing volume than the US, which currently totals 6.7 billion

euros annually.

For over 25 years, we have been a local partner - particularly in South

Carolina. Today, Spartanburg is our largest plant - and the whole of the

surrounding region has grown with us.

China, Europe and the US: Three examples of how our local presence

forges close ties with the regions and markets.

We are living proof that everyone benefits when people work together. That

is also one of the reasons why your company continued to grow in all major

regions of the world in 2023.

We do business around the globe - and benefit from an integrated global

economy.

Now, our global world order is evolving - from a ""unipolar world"" to a

""multi-polar world"", especially in the last 10-15 years. Authors like Carlo

Masala talk about the highly integrated and largely self-sufficient economic

areas now emerging. We remain committed to open markets and free

trade.

I also say this with a view to the European Union's current deliberations

over Chinese imports of electric cars. A 360-degree perspective would be

better: 20 percent of all BEVs sold in Europe last year came from China;

well over half were western brands, including BMW.

Protectionism triggers a spiral effect: Tariffs lead to new tariffs, with

protectionism rather than cooperation.

My over 30 years of experience at BMW suggest that solutions come about

when we reach out to one another - and when we are prepared to make

compromises ourselves.

That is how we build a consensus that makes us stronger as a society and

an economy and enables us to take action.

You are justified in asking how your company secures access to diversified,

fragmented markets.

The answer is: by continuing to invest at local level. Also, by finding local

solutions and partners for the upstream value chain.

""Local for local"" is our recipe for success - and we are now applying this

same principle to producing cells for the batteries needed for e-mobility.

Who has control over technological expertise and urgently needed raw

materials? That is what decides the competitiveness of companies and

economic areas. We locate production facilities for BMW high-voltage

batteries close to our vehicle plants - in Hungary, the US and China. Just a

few days ago, we laid the foundation stone for the high-voltage battery

assembly in San Luis Potosí, Mexico.

The benefits for us are clear: Short transport distances and supply stability

in the event of unforeseen events around the globe.

And to get really local: Have you heard of Irlbach-Straßkirchen in Lower

Bavaria? It will supply Gen6 batteries for our plants in Bavaria from 2026

onwards. The process wasn't entirely straightforward. Residents wanted to

know: What are the benefits for our region? We engaged in in-depth

discussions with them to build trust. Ultimately, an overwhelming majority

voted in favour of the new BMW location.

As you can see: Global only works at local level - and this also applies to

our supply chains.

We have learned in recent years how vulnerable and susceptible to

disruption they can be. Take a guess: How many parts do you think our

plants worldwide need to be supplied with every day? The answer is:

36 million. The right quantities have to be in the right place, at the right

time, in the best quality.

Our digitalised ""i Supply Chain"" strategy ensures resilient supply chains.

Our ""RiskHub"" uses AI and data analytics to identify quality issues in the

supplier network early. We also adopt a proactive approach to avoid supply

bottlenecks.

You might already have heard of Catena-X. There's tremendous potential

here: Automotive manufacturers, suppliers and, soon, recyclers, are

creating a shared data ecosystem that makes sprawling supply chains

transparent and allows us to track the carbon footprint of individual

components. The type, quantity and source of the raw materials installed

can also be digitally documented, allowing us to ""trace"" them.

And we are about to embark on a pilot project: Plant Landshut produces

the kidney grille for the BMW iX* - one component made of many individual

components. We will be using data from Catena-X to measure the total

carbon footprint of production.

Wherever we collaborate with suppliers, we do so as partners, always

treating each other as equals. This is important to me.

Chapter four of my speech focuses on the car as a digital companion: We

are making mobility more human, more intelligent and more sustainable.

The world of bits and bytes is highly dynamic. Digitalisation, hand in hand

with artificial intelligence, is fundamentally changing how we experience

mobility. The questions you submitted through the shareholder portal

indicate that this interests you, too.

Intelligent, self-learning systems have long been part of our strategy for the

automotive production of the future. You know this as BMW iFACTORY.

Digital added value can be experienced directly in our vehicles, but our

approach here remains: Not everything that is possible also makes sense in

a car.

Our Head-Up Display is a classic. 20 years ago, we brought this technology

from the aeroplane into the car. Now, we are revolutionising this display

concept in the NEUE KLASSE.

Take a look for yourselves: Our ""BMW Panoramic Vision"" uses the full

width of the windscreen. Pure high-tech. But we also use digitalization to

increase security. In this case, we reduce distraction while driving.

We have grown used to always getting the latest updates from our digital

devices - and people expect the same from their cars. Over the air means

we can update software in the vehicle at any time, without bringing it in to

the workshop. We chose this route early.

Today, your company has the world's largest fully upgrade-compatible

fleet in the market. We can already reach more than 7.5 million vehicles.

The BMW 5 Series sets the standard for automated driving. It is the first car

in Germany to be approved for partially automated driving at speeds up to

130 km/h on motorways.

This means you can take your hands off the steering wheel while driving.

Your car can also change lanes by itself, when you briefly glance in the side

mirror. Active Lane Change Assistant with eye confirmation - a somewhat

unwieldy name for a genuine world first.

Since March 2024, Highway Assist has also been available in the BMW 7

Series, X5, X6, X7, iX and XM*. That's level 2+.

The new BMW 7 Series does even more:

You can even temporarily turn your attention away from the road. It

fascinates me, every time the car regulates its own speed, distance and

tracking. That is Level 3 highly automated driving - available in the new

BMW 7 Series since March. A digital driving experience needs to ensure the

safety of all road users.

That is why your company only introduces mature technical solutions onto

the road- no beta versions. No experiments at the expense of our

customers. You can always rely on that.

Since summer 2023, we have been testing automated driving and parking

functions all the way up to Level 4 fully automated driving at our new

centre for automated driving in Sokolov in the Czech Republic.

exceptionally well to make it into the top ten and was, in fact, the highestranked automotive manufacturer.

Revenue growth, sustainability and employee satisfaction - many people

consider these to be conflicting goals. We find a way to reconcile them.

Our markets are dynamic and the geopolitical environment uncertain. This

impacts us - just like it does other companies.

You are counting on us to remain successful - and, indeed, we will! We

have ambitious plans for the current financial year. We expect to see a

slight increase in sales, compared to the previous year, as well as a

significantly higher percentage of all-electric vehicles.

The first fourth months of 2024 show that we are on track for all key

performance indicators.

As CEO of BMW, I travel the world a lot. Everywhere I go, I see not only how

valuable individual mobility is for many people, but how essential it is.

My experience is also that the BMW Group is appreciated and recognised in

all corners of the globe. All of this encourages us to continue forging our

own BMW way.

We are able to withstand the headwinds when we have confidence in our

direction - which we usually do.

Your company is part of the global community. We engage with it - and

evolve in and alongside it. That is extremely important.

The BMW way is also about our capacity for resonance - a term from

physics that is also used in sociology.

So, what do I mean by capacity for resonance?

I'm talking about our ability to perceive and understand our relationship

with the world - in Germany and elsewhere. We pay attention to

developments, absorb them - and give something back to society in return.

Barbara Seidlova - Investor Relations

Hello, everyone and welcome to CEZ Group Conference Call on First Quarter 2024 Results. Martin Novak, Chief Financial Officer, will go through the presentation and then, we will have room to ask questions for which we also have Mr. Ludak Horn, Head of Trading available for the answers.

Now, I'm handing over to Martin to go through the presentation.

Martin Novak

Thank you. Good afternoon and good morning to everybody. So, I'll start with a brief presentation. On the first table, you can actually see our financial highlights and the full year outlook. Our EBITDA has grown by 24% to CZK40.3 billion. Our net income and at the same time adjusted net income has reached CZK13.6 billion or 25% improvement year-on-year. We confirm our guidance of CZK115 billion to CZK120 billion for 2024 and on EBITDA and adjusted net income, at a level of CZK25 billion to CZK30 billion. So, there is no change compared to our last presentation that was out on March 21.

On the next slide, you can actually see main variances between Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. As I already said, our EBITDA has grown by 24% and you can see the main factors actually on Slide #4 there, the biggest variances are basically two. The first one is in the segment of generation - on generation segment. Last year in first quarter, we had an additional cost of CZK10 billion related to price caps on various power plants as it was introduced by the government. And actually full year cost at the same time was as well, CZK10 billion. So basically, all those caps are drop payments above those caps have materialized in the first quarter. Clearly, this has been - this is not valid any longer, December 2023 and that's why we don't have this extraordinary cost. And therefore, we have CZK10 billion lower cost, meaning CZK10 billion better result in Q1 2024. At the same time, we also seen narrower margins, mainly on the lignite plants. So, about CZK5 billion, so, this is partially compensating those lack of those price caps.

On the Sales segment, we had a negative result of CZK3 billion in our retail business last year. Now, we are kind of back to normal. So, CZK800 million positive or a result, which makes total of difference with other little items of CZK4.2 billion positive. So, those are two main variances, actually now EBITDA. Going to net income. Main changes actually in net income are mainly in our interest income and expenses where we have a little bit higher interest expense or to the other way revenue on interest received due to declining interest - the interest rates. We have somewhat higher nuclear provisions, and there is also segment other income and expenses and there is a revaluation of financial derivatives of CZK2.2 billion negative, which helps - which show a clear function of weakening Czech crown. So, in total, we are going down to CZK13.6 billion, which is CZK2.7 billion better than last year, or 25% growth.

On next slide, you can see total operating results in our volumetric units, which we can probably skip and go to Slide #7 where we are actually confirming our guidance from March CZK115 billion to CZK120 billion on EBITDA and CZK25 billion to CZK30 billion net income. The main, a year-over-year effects on EBITDA are expected lower trading results. As the last year, we have the second best trading result in our history. The first, even the first the best result was actually in 2022 due to high volatility of prices, we don't expect such a volatility and therefore we expect lower trading result. We have also lower sales of for ancillary services. We have higher cost due to inflation. And on the other hand, as a positive, we have still power prices that are little bit higher, the effect of our hedging in previous years and we don't pay CZK10 billion in the - in caps so on power prices. So, there are also selective assumptions, so listed and the projects and risks. So, clearly opportunity is a better trading result than anticipated and the negative downside is always availability of generation facilities, mainly the nuclear.

On the next slide, you can actually see new nuclear events. In Dukovany, we actually received the updated base for the construction of new nuclear power plants from two bidders, which is French EDF and Korean KHNP. It is also submitted on the 30th of April. And now we are actually analyzing the dates. We will hand it over to the government who will of, based on our recommendation, make a choice of the winner. And the final contract should be signed by March 31, 2025. There is no change in the - in the schedule, so the unit should start operating in 2036. EU has also approved actually state aid for our nuclear regulated Dukovany with the parameters listed. So, basically government provides interest free financing. We get the - that, there should be actually repaid within a few decades. We will receive CFD basically for 40 years and the of course we will be protected against the changes in the legislation and regulatory environment in the Czech Republic.

So, now let's go to segment of generation mining. So, on the Slide 10, you have a lot of detail in this segment. I have covered the most important factors, which is basically no - a little bit on the nuclear plants or on our production portfolio. Mainly, it is actually seen in nuclear. You can see that on the second line item, actually, nuclear has improved its operations from CZK10.7 billion to CZK19.9 billion and the main reason is that nuclear was mainly subject to price curves as the price cap on nuclear unit was around €70 versus coal units were around €180. So, that's the main variance. You can also see emission generating facilities, as I said, are impacted by higher carbon credits. So, CZK11 billion in 2023 and CZK5.9 billion EBITDA in 2024 declined 47%. More details actually in the text.

Then, when you look at the next slide, Slide 11, you can see our nuclear and renewable generation, so emission-free generation. We had a slight decline actually in the nuclear facilities, but this is a different on scheduled and cover planned outages. Overall year-on-year, the plan is to be 1% below last year again because of the outages. So, for renewables, we plan to be about 4% higher due to better than average hydrological conditions in the Czech Republic and we also have new installed capacity in Germany.

On the next slide, you can see Chilean electricity generation from coal and natural gas. Now, there is a quarterly, quarterly decline of 2% in total, 16% on gas, mainly due to market conditions, meaning gas price, electricity price and carbon credit price, 38% decline in Poland, the same effect and 5% increase actually in the Czech Republic, mainly due to shorter outages in two of our power plants. Year-on-year, we plan decline actually in the Czech Republic of 8% on coal, 8% in Poland and 9% increase in gas. So, in total, we plan a 6% decline actually in our electricity generation, that is coal and natural gas based. Risk prices, hedging, we are basically almost fully sold for this year, only 3% open position for this year and 0% basically sold - open position in the carbon credits.

On next slide, you can see the level of hedges for 2025 through 2028 and the same in carbon credit side. So, looking at the prices, you can clearly see that we are above current levels of market prices forward prices in actually for 2025 through 2028 due to our hedges in the past. The same applies to carbon credits that are somewhat more expensive, but at the same time, we were selling electricity at much higher prices, so always kind of locking up our margin when we sell coal-based electricity. Distribution and Sales Segment is actually on the next slide.

So on Slide #16, you can see our EBITDA distribution, which is 10% higher. So, mainly due to higher margin from distribution fees grows, there was a very significant growth in the fees. We have lower revenues from connection activities and providing balancing the grid and connecting and connecting new customers, so there's less demand and we have also somewhat higher expenses due to inflation, wage inflation. So, well, electricity distribution is 1% lower after we actually climate and calendar adjusted, it is 1% higher quarter-on-quarter.

Sales segment EBITDA or incremental a bit on the retail segment. We had a negative impact in 2023 because sales, retail, retail customers are paying the same price per megawatt overall metrologies January or July or our April. We actually entered the year with somewhat open position. So, in the first quarter, our sales organization had to pay more for the power and it made the money back actually in the few in the out quarters, but compared first quarter to first quarter 2023, 2024 and power prices were much more stable, we are actually at a significant difference of CZK4.2 billion positive where just today, which is our retail organization is returning back to standard operations, I would say, seeing such a swings in profits. Other companies basically have incurred marginal changes in the performance. So, overall, the segment is made profit of CZK2.6 billion, which is variance of CZK4.2 billion.

Volume of electricity and gas sold, year-on-year change in electricity, natural gas supplies is 11%. This is mainly due to extremely warm winter. So, consumption of both gas and electricity went down. We had a slight change in customer base with 1% negative as but this is a reaction to the times when we gained about 300,000 customers from the collapse of a few operators in 2021 and 2022. Now, actually, we have 1% decline, mainly due to customers who are always seeking the best offer and it's always part of our portfolio. So, that's the main reason. And of course, we are always discussing the optimization of the number of customers, and the [indiscernible] margin. So it's not necessary to keep all customers or to simply say.

Revenue from sales of energy services are growing in all our segments. Germany clearly the large jump due to acquisition or a few companies year-on-year, we expect mainly organic growth, but nevertheless in Germany we expect 13% growth. In Czech Republic, we expect the decline, but this is due to major contracts, one of contracts that as we actually had in our group and especially decrease in commodity prices where we had a significant profit on our corporate customers actually in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2024. Overall, the segment will be growing by 4%, the full year numbers as to make complete numbers of sales for this CZK3.8 billion. And that's basically you know lot of information premise. So, now I think we are open to questions and answers.

Yes. So, if you have a question, just raise your hand. I will call your name and you can ask your questions. We have the first question from Anna Webb.

Anna Webb

Yes, hi. Anna Webb from UBS. Thank you for taking my question. Two from me, if I can. Firstly, on the nuclear, as you said on the slides, you've got the approval for the support framework from the European Commission in the last couple of weeks for the first units. And one thing I would like to understand is this it mentions to protect against changes in legislative or regulatory environment, but I wondered if you could help us understand more broadly how much risk CEZ has to bear for cost and time overruns. We've seen very significant overruns in recent nuclear projects in Europe, for example, Hinkley Point in the UK. So just wondering what kind of protection you have from potential additional costs and how they're considered when calculating a fair return under the CFD framework? Any detail you could provide that would be really helpful.

And then, secondly, on the Polish assets that you've got up for sale, I think I saw some headlines this morning saying that you expect to make a decision this year, but can you give us a bit more detail on whether you're seeing good interest in these assets at reasonable valuations and if you don't receive satisfactory offers, what's the next step for these assets, would you consider decommissioning those yourself? Thank you very much.

Martin Novak

Thank you. So I'll answer the questions. First on nuclear, the structure is that we actually are now financing the first stage, which is up €180 million, basically getting it to the selection of the winner, then after actually we move to an interface and winner is selected and the work starts. It will be financed directly through the state budget with interest free loan. We will get the CFD at the end and in the middle or of course if things go wrong, we have a maximum, we have some exposure, but limited about €1.7 billion. This is maximum that is at risk if things go wrong on our side as our outflow, everything else will be covered by the state and this should be reflected in the agreement on the CFD anyway, so that the profitability for us is there. And we also have a system of cool and good options so that if things go terribly wrong, we will be able to put the project on the government or the government will be able to call the project.

So that's - that's what it is. Of course, the details have to be negotiated, then nailed down, but this is how the system should work. As we realized that there is a huge risk of budget overruns, so it can be seen basically on most of the projects. The biggest issue is also financing, up there few more years of construction means added cost on interest, and that's why actually the government support and financing is interest free until the commissioning of the plant, let it start generating cash, only then actually interest kicks in. So that's the model.

The second question was actually what we really do, the proposals that. We are now going through this stage of collecting on binding offers. We can see - we can see much stronger demand than when we've been trying to solely the assets a few years ago, after we actually analyzed the non-binding bids, we will proceed with the selected bidders to the next stage through due diligence stage and actually see what happens, but the decision, whether we sell or don't sell, should definitely be made this year will be definitely made this year. If we don't sell for whatever reasons, we don't agree on price or the bidders will be able to pull together, financing, whatever it can happen. We will definitely not want to stay and generate power from coal assets in Poland. So, we will have to seek a different route of how to divest those assets and of course, decommissioning those assets could be one of the options and may be selling the selling actually the land, is a brownfield for another potential investment could be a choice.

Hello. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on the 2024 financial targets, pro forma EBITDA and on the - on net income. I've noticed that the divisional breakdown that you provide on EBITDA is actually slightly better than it was at the full year results. And so, I was wondering if basically that means that you are tracking ahead of your initial guidance mid-point at the moment or if there are any negatives in the second part of the year that we should that we should have in mind that should offset the trend of your EBITDA in Q1.

The second question is a follow-up on the state aid approval on the new nuclear unit, especially on the CFD. So, you talked a bit about the financing. I was wondering, what are - what would be the potential implications for the current CEZ Group structure, does it mean that the current group structure is adequate for to implement this agreement that has been approved or will any change be needed? Thank you very much.

Martin Novak

So, first question, actually, I think we still Arthur - although, we are kind of you could think ahead of our target, our business is very seasonal. And although, look at for the past many years, first quarter is it, by far the strongest and this question comes of course, every time towards the end of the year, it is more and more difficult than we had quarters when we were close to zero, actually, not net income, mainly due to various asset write-offs and so on, which we don't expect. If we expected them, we would have done it already, but we don't know how the situation will develop, of course. So, now actually we feel very comfortable with the range that we provided that we should be definitely getting there. And but should we be sure that the guidance could be approved, we would have done it.

So, basically another review will come before the 10th of August when we are presenting or 8th of August and you remember the date exactly when we present our numbers for first half of this year. So, that's where we are actually in our guidance. And state aid approval structure, the deal is structured in such a way that actually it is the financing will be provided to our subsidiary, so not to us, but subsidiary, SPV that is holding actually land and the employees who are working on the project and therefore any time it can be response into state hands if things don't go according to expectation and basically nothing touches our structure. So we don't accept the debt on the corporate level and push it down to the nuclear unit project, but it is direct financing actually for SPV.

Yes, thank you. I have two questions. The first one on the seasonality on the nuclear area in the first quarter. Could you give us more details on the reasons for such a high seasonality because, I don't think it's on the volumes and it appears that we should see strong decline in nuclear EBITDA in the next quarter regarding your segment guidance. And the second question, can you say something more about your today guidance or target on the net debt to EBITDA grow from 1 to 3, what is the time horizon, what are the largest CapEx positions, you mentioned earlier that you want to focus on distribution, renewables, gas and nuclear plants. Thank you.

Martin Novak

So thank you for the question. So nuclear EBITDA, as I commented, CZK19 billion show impacted or more than CZK19 billion. It's impacted by the fact that actually last year we had a levy of CZK10 billion, which was mainly related to nuclear assets. There were price caps on the assets. And of course, coal plants really were not impacted, but nuclear plants were impacted in first quarter of last year. So we actually had now CZK10 billion lower cost. And if you actually take the same the same amount or if you would actually add those CZK10 billion, you would be basically on the even numbers for first quarter of 2023 and before nuclear plants also with outages planned usually done during summer, summer months. So, it's really if it kind of really is in accordance with our expectation. So, that's the nuclear EBITDA for three months. The net debt to EBITDA target or limit, I would better call it three, net debt to EBITDA both have EBITDA would be in the future and our CapEx plans are mainly directed to the development of renewables in the Czech Republic.

Then replacement of coal plants with gas fleet, as profitability of coal plants is declining fairly quickly and we need something to replace temporary place, so on those plants until the moment we have enough renewables and nuclear plants and this is all subject to introduction of capacity payment system without, which it will be difficult to take a risk of building CCGPs that may just electricity and not gas and not heat. And of course, we start first - first, actually plants will be conversions in heat business. And third one is actually is, as I said, distribution. We still invest quite a lot of money into our distribution assets, improving our grid, connecting new customers, connecting new renewables, all, this requires relatively high CapEx. So those are the main areas of CapEx and of course, then development in ESCO. There it is mainly both financial investments and of course, the largest, the largest amount that will increase our debt [indiscernible] actually consolidated gasoline, that would mean that it will be consolidated in their debt and their EBITDA as well and I think they have net debt to EBITDA something like €5 as the regulated assets. In such a case, if we receive all the regulatory improvements approvals and we believe we will, we will - we will be able to increase our net debt target ratio to above €3 to something like €3.3, €3.5 maximum.

Just one question, you can find our 5-year CapEx outlook in the annual report where you can see the segmental breakdown and the figures for the years of 2023 until 2028. We can take the next question from Piotr Dzieciolowski.

Piotr Dzieciolowski

Hi, good afternoon. It's Piotri Dziecilowski from Citi. So I have two questions. Let me start with the first one. So, is the current structure for the new nuclear really excluding the option for the breakup of the company and the buyout of the minorities? And second, in this structure, how much equity will have to put into the subsidiary?

Martin Novak

Okay. So, maximum, it could be, if things go wrong over the 11-year project construction that we would be - we would have to put would be something like €1.7 billion, which is so-called contingent liquidity. And that's it. There is a cap, no more. If things don't go wrong, we wouldn't. And they only have to go wrong because of us. For example, because of a supplier of the nuclear unit. The rest is funded by state, whatever it is. Buyout of minorities, I think for us it's a question to Ministry of Finance, rather to us, but we don't see any signals from the market that this will be an issue because those they just received actually notification approval from EU Commission based on this model. So, I don't think they really see a need to buy minorities to be able to carry on this project. And for us when we take care of all the risks budget overruns and other productions or to be able to for the project on state, then the risk is fairly minimum for us as well. And so that's basically there's been good scheme that is in place today.

Piotr Dzieciolowski

Okay. And can I please ask you the next three reactors, how do you see the structure for them, will that be done in the similar way for you or that would be another third party involved in it there.

Martin Novak

So, this is only structure from one reactor. If it is more in the one reactor, it will be it has to be different approach, different structure and new notification.

Piotr Dzieciolowski

Okay. But is that possible that let's say for the second reactor, you do the same way, so you provide a kind of into SPV, another CZK1.7 billion, and you do the same structure and then...

Martin Novak

I don't think we would be able to afford it actually. So, there would have to be a different structure. I think CZK1.7 billion is the maximum that we could do, but we couldn't do 2x CZK1.7 billion, I think. So, we would have to really, this is a structure for one reactor. If it's more than one, we have to find a different more and probably different annual notification. So, far we have one reactor enough and we received kind of notification for one reactor only. So, we cannot really multiply it by two, three or four.

Piotr Dzieciolowski

Okay. Can I please ask you the last question, how do you think about the dividend policy in the context of your CapEx plans and getting to that 3x leverage plus new nuclear development. What - how do you think, what's the right payout and when this could be really reached?

Martin Novak

So, our officially announced dividend policy, when we actually were proposing dividend for 2022, is 60% to 80% of adjusted net income. However, shareholders may decide differently a little bit last year on the shareholder meeting. The Ministry of Finance brought the proposal that the dividend higher, but so far we are thinking of 60% to 80%, that's sufficient range for dividend, which doesn't mean...

Piotr Dzieciolowski

I am asking not about the 2022 payout because this, but more like a '27 to 2030 when you start all of the investments on your balance sheet, let's call. Do you think that company can sustain 60% to 80% payout or the long-term ultimate payout needs to be lower?

Martin Novak

We are very far from '27 to '28. It depends on the power prices, depends on the cost of investment, depends on the profitability of the projects, may happen that they will not be in the money. And that's why we would not do them and we make sure it makes your situation. It changes your situation as well. So, we understand that all shareholders are buying our shares because of the dividend, is a dividend stock mature company. So, we have to balance those things go very well, but 2027 and 2028 is far from now.

Yes. Hi. It's Robert Maj from Ipopema Securities. On the CapEx front, I am trying to get my head around the numbers that you plan for 2024 versus this year, are you on track of reaching the CapEx from your - from your guidance? And on the new nuclear, I mean is this €1.7 billion included in those numbers you mentioned, you provided in the last financial, 2023 report or is it outside of this? And the second question on the sales segment performance in the first quarter, I mean the result was quite good. And I just wonder if this is something that would be repeatable in the following quarters. So, last year we had a loss in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter and there was like in the middle there was like a positive result. So, how the margin over there would evolve in following quarters in 2024? Thank you.

Martin Novak

I think in our CapEx plans, we have only €118 million, so invested into nuclear projects, nothing else, because those €1.7 billion will really be grown during the construction phase, which is years from now if things go wrong and it's our fault. So, we really it is definitely beyond our 5-year budget that we do. And regarding sales segment, sales segment was extremely volatile in 2022 and '23 as you could see on the results. In the past when prices were more stable, their result was also more stable, always generating positive EBITDA and if nothing really significant changes, you would expect that they would be back into normal base of profit generation.

Robert Maj

And so, what will be the CapEx for 2024, if you can just remind us?

That's more than CZK45 billion last year, right, so the difference and this is without GasNet, right.

Okay. So, the majority would go were in the ESCO business, the difference between this year CZK57 billion your guidance in the last year, where the money will go?

Barbara Seidlova

It is across various segments. One is increased spending in nuclear, both into the nuclear fuel and some increased maintenance. We are starting working on the first gas projects and we expect basically a ramp up in the CapEx, in the renewables.

Robert Maj

Okay. And when the GasNet would be consolidated, I reckon it could be in the third quarter, so I guess that on the second quarter result publication, you would increase your guidance, right, because simply of adding this CZK10 billion of EBITDA for GasNet, am I right.

Martin Novak

The frequency, we are going to spend, we would - we will put them into numbers, of course...

Robert Maj

And this we should think about third quarter is the first time, when you will consolidate if you consolidate, right?

Martin Novak

Right. Globally and if we - it depends really when we will be able to acquire it in the second quarter, which we are done below or probably third quarter depending on regulatory approvals.

Barbara Seidlova

Yes. As we mentioned, we are waiting for the approval from the European Commission and we don't know the timing, so we don't know when we will consolidate it.

Yes. Thank you very much. Apologies for the third question, it was just - I was just wondering if you could provide an update on the evolution of the windfall tax in the Czech Republic, specifically thinking of 2025. Thank you very much.

Martin Novak

Okay. So, we have heard from public resources comments from Minister of Finance and Minister of Finance, the government is strongly thinking of basically discontinuing this tax for 2025. We also heard that they might be thinking again about '24, but some political parties in the coalition are against it, some support it, so let's see. So, hopefully '25 will be almost certain. But on the other hand, no legal initiative has been taken. On the other hand, it's very simple. It's just changing one sentence and do all. You don't have to do any complicated change to the law. So, basically, you raise 2025 or even 2024, which would be probably too optimistic, but let's see. So, this is where the public debate is actually heading today.

Hi. Andrzej, PKO BP Securities. Thank you for the presentation. Just one question from my side. So, what's your opinion from the point of view of key market player, do you think that four nuclear reactors in the Czech Republic are essential for the system in the upcoming years or do you think that, I don't know, maybe one or two more units would be more reasonable. Thank you.

Martin Novak

So, I think from energy point of view or an overly point of view, we can clearly see future trend into more and more using electricity versus other kinds of fuel. And our fleet will be discontinued within few decades, coal plants fairly quickly, older Dukovany plant, it does not have indefinite lifetime either. So, clearly just replacing currently real problems in Dukovany is 2,000 megawatt replacing capacity in coal plants is even more so and gas pumps will be kind of transitional - transition technology, which still generate some CO2 and we are not there fully talking about building them all at once. So, this is a project for decades and that's - so we can from energy point of view, we can see a need. It depends on what will be the pace of such a construction.

We have another question from Piotr Dzieciolowski.

Piotr Dzieciolowski

Hi. Thank you for letting me ask the follow-up question. So, I have a question on the CFD structure for the new nuclear. How should we think about the level of it given that debt funding is provided by the government, but what is the basically the return you possibly could get on your 1.7 billion equity injection into the company? And second question, I wanted to ask you about your kind of higher CapEx for the nuclear reinvestments. What is the CapEx you need to spend to refurbish the existing nuclear plant, how much per plant or for all of that Dukovany and Temelin, how much and when you to spend to keep them running?

Martin Novak

So, I will answer the equity question. Of course, we would expect through CFD to receive return on equity that we will provide that relates to standard, let's say generation projects, whatever level of return on equity it is. So, standard return on standard generation project that's what we would expect and this should be actually built into CFD in the future. So, that's the answer. And the detail on the CapEx will be provided by Barbara.

Barbara Seidlova

Yes. Okay. So, on the maintenance of the nuclear fleet, historically we were spending typically between CZK4 billion and CZK5 billion a year. Now, as the plants are getting older and we have inflation going forward into 2024 to '27, we expect maintenance CapEx of around CZK8 billion per year for two units together.

Piotr Dzieciolowski

But do you have to go into it like for example, we take the other reactors across Europe, they have to go through the normal 10-year revisions. And at that point, EDF has a program whereby they spend like, almost a CZK1 billion per plant in retrofitting them to give them another 10 years or you take Fortum Loviisa, they also spend a CZK1 billion for extension. Do you have to do the same, because there is quite a - that would be quite substantial CapEx in your case, given your capacity in nuclear?

Martin Novak

No, we don't have it this way. We actually use the tenure, so now, we change to indefinite tenor. But you have to fulfill certain criteria. So, that's how - now actually licensing is done in past few years. And also, until you are able to fulfill criteria and it's economic to do that, you cannot - you can go for it and make sure thing is to make the lifetime of Dukovany we are looking at extending the lifetime up to 60 years if I am not mistaken. And so, that's what we are aiming at. And of course, past 10 years would be probably most expensive in terms of CapEx, on the other hand, still very profitable. So, it's...

Much better to maintain current nuclear plant than to build a new one, simply said.

Okay. It seems that we don't have any further questions, so let's finish this call. As always, Investor Relations department is available for any follow-ups on one-on-one basis.

Full transcript - Veolia Environnement (EPA: VIE ) VE (OTC: VEOEY ) Q1 2024:

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Veolia Q1 2024 Key Figures Conference Call with Estelle Brachlianoff, CEO; and Claude Laruelle, CFO. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded May 14, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Estelle Brachlianoff. Please go ahead.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this conference call to present Veolia's results for the first quarter of '24. And with me is Claude Laruelle, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter results are, once again, excellent. They are perfectly in line with our annual objective and enable us to start 2024 with great confidence and fully confirm our guidance for the year. And I'm on Slide 4 where you would see sales came to €11.5 billion, up 3.9%, excluding energy price, which are essentially pass-through for us, as you know. EBITDA has increased by substantial 5.7% on a like-for-like basis to €1.624 billion and current EBIT by 11.1% to €843 million. Net financial debt is well under control and in line with our target of leverage ratio below 3x at year-end. These results are the fruit of our unique positioning as the world's leader of environmental services, which, combined with the sustained effort and professional efficiency enables us to deliver both resilience and growth of our results. The last few months have confirmed the choices of our next strategic program, GreenUp, which, for instance, the critical importance for both cities and industries of deploying solutions to tackle water scarcity and onshore water quality, those challenges where Veolia has a leadership position, as you know. I'm on Slide 5. And you can see we registered very solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy price, fueled in particular by Water and Waste, which grew by 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Regarding Energy, as anticipated, lower energy price has weighted on our top line, but our Energy revenue has been flat, excluding the effect of energy price and has even grown by 1% if you exclude negative weather effect in the first quarter. As you know, our Energy margin as in EBITDA is well protected from the ups and downs of energy price, which showed again in the first quarter. Actually, we expect 2024 Energy EBITDA to remain at the high level we reached last year despite lower energy price. How is that so? Veolia is quite unique in the energy market since we operate in local energy only as we explained last January during our deep dive dedicated to energy. As I've said, we anticipated this, which is the reason why we have published our revenue growth, excluding energy price, each quarter since 2022 as they do not impact our performance. Energy is a profitable and growing activity for Veolia. Slide 6. In order to detail how we've delivered another quarter of very good results, I would like to start by briefly explaining Veolia's recipe for value creation, which lies in 3 key engines: top line growth, efficiency and capital allocation. Starting with revenue growth. We combined stronghold activities, which were very resilient essential services, infrastructure-like with three growth boosters, namely, water technologies and new solutions, hazardous waste treatment and bioenergies, flexibility and energy efficiency. Our stronghold activities enjoy security and high contract renewal rates. Anchored in those, our booster activities grew at mid- to high single-digit rates as they are driven by strong market trends and Veolia's unique positioning, water quality and scarcity, regulation to protect health and reshoring, just to mention a few. The second pillar of value creation is our strict management of operations and attention to delivery. Each year, we deliver €350 million of efficiency gains, which have been topped up by cost synergies of the Suez merger, an addition of €500 million over 5 years -- 4 years, sorry. The third pillar is our capital allocation. We target high value-creating projects or tuck-in acquisitions in line with our strategic priorities. So typically our 3 growth boosters, all the geographies in which we want to expand. Our internal rule is IRR above WACC plus 4% and ROCE above WACC after year 3 for these investments. Meanwhile, we constantly review our portfolio of assets to check if there is still some value creation ahead. If not or when the asset is not in line with our strategy, typically construction or FM activities or subscale presence, we may decide to sell. This value creation model is the backbone of our GreenUp plan with current net income growth of 10% per annum on average and the dividend growing in line with EPS and ROCE post-tax above 9% in 2027. I'm on Slide 8, and let me detail now each of those 3 pillars of value creation and the way they have translated into Q1 results, starting with top line growth. In Q1, we delivered solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, thanks to continued strong foundation with regards to indexation, pricing, contract renewal and new wins. In addition to a particularly strong performance in the Water Tech booster, both in delivery and new order book, up 50% in Q1 to €1.8 billion. In terms of geographies, Australia, the Middle East and the U.S., which you know are our growth boosters, performed particularly well, each of them above 6% growth, which is aligned with our ambition laid in our GreenUp plan. On Page 9, you have a focus on the performance of activities defined as stronghold in our GreenUp plan, which performed very well in Q1. Water municipal operations and Solid Waste revenue progressed very well, thanks to commercial momentum, better volumes, [indiscernible] indexation and continued pricing power. So 30% of our contracts, which are not indexed. District heating networks were flat, excluding energy price, due to mild weather in Central and Eastern Europe, but will have progressed otherwise. All registered strong commercial wins, notably the renewal of the SEDIF contract, which I'm very pleased with, as you would expect. As you know, and I'm now on Page 10, this contract provides water services for 4 million inhabitants in 132 municipalities around Paris for a total revenue of €4 billion over 12 years. We managed to renew this contract, thanks in particular to a series of very innovative solutions, which will make this contract a worldwide reference of water services of the 21st century with 10 world-firsts. These include the combination of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to treat all new pollutants from PFAS to pesticide residues or endocrine disruptors as well to AI to help improve network efficiency to 93%, just to mention a few. As you can see, innovation is really at the heart of what we do at Veolia. On Page 11, now we'll focus on the performance of our GreenUp booster activities in Q1. Water Technologies continued to perform excessively well in terms of sales, earnings and bookings. Revenue grew by 15% in all our lines of business within Water Tech, while booking increased by 50% to €1.8 billion, including another big success in desalination in Dubai at Hassyan. In local decarbonizing energy, we continue to grow in flexibility with a 430-megawatt assets acquired from Uniper in Hungary, which will complement our own asset -- set of assets in this country. As you know, with this promising and strategic market, which is critical to the grid given the development of renewables, and with this operation, Veolia now has 2.4 gigawatts of managed flexible electrical energy in Europe. Still in local decarbonizing energy. In France, we are installing a series of solar panels on our landfills, which will produce 300 megawatts of green electricity by 2027. On Slide 12, you can see a list of some of the bookings in Water Tech we have recorded in Q1 with several contracts in semiconductors or oil and gas. On the Hassyan desalination project, I'm very proud that we'll have, with this one, the most energy-efficient worldwide desalination in the world and not a small one because it will serve 2 million inhabitants. And actually, when I said energy-efficient, we have crossed the floor of 3-kilowatt hour per cubic meter of water produced, which seemed unreachable only 10 years ago and which is a 35% reduction compared to 10 years ago and even 5x lower than the project we designed 30 years ago. You can see with this example that Veolia innovation helps save energy, money and CO2. On Slide 14, now let's deep dive into our second lever of value creation, which is performance and efficiency. You can see on this slide our first quarter performance in terms of operating efficiency and synergies. In terms of efficiency, we achieved €88 million in gains, in line with our annual target of €350 million. I'm pleased to see the specific action plan launched in France late last year bear its first fruits in Q1. In addition, we have fixed or exited a few underperforming contracts, notably one in Canada. In terms of cost synergies derived from the Suez merger, we are ahead of schedule and have achieved €42 million in Q1, or cumulative of €357 million since the start of the merger with Suez. Safe to say that the efficiency program are now part of the DNA and will remain so, leveraging on our more than 3,000 plants and units worldwide. But we are constantly looking for new tools and new opportunities, such as GenAI now, which we have dozen tests underway as we speak. The last driver of our value creation is capital allocation where we were particularly active in Q1, and I'm on Slide 16. Our CapEx program continued at a sustained pace with ongoing projects to build new hazardous waste treatment facilities in the U.S., Germany and Saudi. All those projects will be commissioned in 2025 and will fuel growth and increase return in this activity, which is among the 3 boosters of our GreenUp plan. As you know, Hazardous Waste already accounts for 10% of group sales and we are the world leader present on all continents. In parallel, we continued the conversion plan of our coal-fired facilities with €95 million invested during the first quarter in Poland and the Czech Republic. We expect a double-digit return from our decarbonization CapEx and are already benefiting from the higher profitability of our new Braunschweig facility, which was converted last year. We have been quite active in terms of bolt-on acquisition as well from Uniper flexibility assets in Hungary to recycling activities in Germany. Those two tuck-ins are a perfect illustration of our business model as they complement our existing asset footprint perfectly and generate significant synergies from day 1. And on February 29, we completed the disposal of Sade, as this construction activity, mainly in France, was noncore and with an EBITDA margin of around 5% dilutive for the rest of the group. These very good results in Q1 confirms the strength of our business model, which we summarize on Slide 18. Veolia is very resilient as we provide social services, both to municipal and industrial clients, with full asset ownership and more than 90% of renewal contracts. 85% of sales are not exposed to the economic cycle. We are protected against inflation, thanks to contract indexation formulas and our pricing power as we've proven and sustained in the last 3 years. We enjoy leadership position in all our key countries, which has proven key to pricing power, in particular. We benefit from balanced geographical footprint with 40% outside Europe, of which more than $5 billion in the U.S., no country outside the U.S. with more than 10% of the group's capital employed. Of course, in addition to these strengths, Veolia enjoys growth thanks to supportive megatrends and the unique positioning as the world leader of environmental services. Water quality, water scarcity, socioeconomic challenges, hazardous waste treatment, decarbonization are here to stay and we are the key to enabling our customers to grow sustainably. To illustrate our unique positioning, I'm now on Slide 19, let me give this example of PFAS, which is the case in point. Thanks to our innovation and the set of patented technologies we've developed, which includes membranes and resins as well as high-temperature incineration, we are now ready to treat these emerging pollutants. The combination of our various businesses in Water Technologies, Water operations as well as Hazardous Waste enable us to offer an end-to-end solution. Our presence in the U.S. when those pollutants were first detected has helped us to anticipate and be ready to treat this pollutant in Europe now. And actually things are moving fast in PFAS. In the first quarter alone, we've seen in the U.S. two new regulations from the EPA, which represents an estimated market for remediation and solutions estimated to $250 billion in the U.S. alone. Veolia has already started to treat PFAS [indiscernible] with water in [indiscernible] water in France, in the U.S. and in Australia. So I'm now on Slide 20. Veolia is a unique global leader in environmental services, ideally positioned to address fast-growing demand trends across the globe from water scarcity to decarbonization and decontamination to protection and health as the case of PFAS strategy illustrates. Our international presence in 44 countries and in the top 3 niche of our key countries is a key success factor as much as our strongly engaged workforce. On Slide 21, the very strong Q1 results allow me to fully confirm our target for 2024 and are very much in line with our GreenUp objectives. The financial and nonfinancial objective of our strategic plan are summarized in this slide. They include current net income growth of an average of 10% per year with dividends growing in line with EPS. I now hand over to Claude who will detail the Q1 '24 results before we both dive to your questions. Claude?

Claude Laruelle: Thank you, Estelle, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm on Slide 23. And as Estelle already highlighted, our Q1 2024 results are, once again, remarkable and allow us to be very confident for the rest of the year. With €11.5 billion revenue, we experienced a good organic revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, driven by good commercial momentum and improved Water and Waste volumes, continued favorable indexation on our long-term contracts and price increases on nonindexed businesses. Taking into account the impact of lower energy prices, revenue was down by 1.7%, as expected, without impact on EBITDA. Thanks to the operating leverage and the good delivery of synergies, we enjoyed a solid organic EBITDA growth of 5.7% at €1.624 billion and a current EBIT growth of 11.1% at €843 million. Net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. You can also see on the slide the detailed ForEx impact, which were negative in Q1, minus €228 million at revenue level and minus €58 million at EBITDA level. Assuming the exchange rates remain at today's level, the full year impact at EBITDA level would be between €70 million and €80 million. As a reminder, as we operate in local currency, ForEx impacts are only translation and not transaction impacts. On Slide 24, you have our usual revenue bridge detailing the different effects and showing our top line intrinsic growth of 4.5% composed of commercial wins and pricing, those two green boxes on the right-hand side of the bridge. Looking at the full bridge in more details, what do we see? First, ForEx had a negative impact of minus 1.9%, mostly in Latin America. Second, scope impact is limited, minus 0.1%, after Sade disposal in February and a few tuck-ins. As a reminder, Sade is a construction business with low margin. For organic growth, we continued to enjoy solid growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, which is fueled by good commercial momentum, volume growth, strong growth activities, price and indexation increase in Water and Waste. The main item on the bridge is, of course, the lower energy prices for €679 million, with almost no impact on EBITDA. Recyclate prices have stabilized and the impact is insignificant in Q1 at revenue and EBITDA levels. The weather impact was unfavorable, minus 0.4%, compared to 2023, which was already mild. We experienced, in fact, the warmest winter over the last 30 years in Central Europe. Moving to Slide 25. You can see the revenue evolution by geographical segment and I start with Water Technologies, which delivered another very strong quarter, both in terms of revenue and bookings. Revenue are up 15% with sustained growth in all our business lines. And in terms of bookings, as Estelle said, we registered a record level of bookings of €1.8 billion, including more than €600 million in the U.S. In the Rest of the World, all regions performed very well. Notably, Australia had a very strong growth of 8.5%, thanks to good Waste performance, several contract wins, strict pricing discipline and good landfill volumes. Latin America grew double digits, thanks to good Waste volumes and pricing. Underlying activity was well oriented in Brazil, Chile and Colombia with several new contracts. To take a few, Las Salinas in Chile for soil remediation or Braskem biomass in Brazil. Africa/Middle East revenue was up 4%, thanks to strong business in Morocco and new energy efficiency contracts in the Middle East in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi. North America continued to enjoy solid Hazardous Waste performance and good Water activity. In Hazardous waste, for example, we benefited from a favorable mix effect and average prices are up 7%. In Asia, solid growth in Hong Kong, plus 10%, with a very strong performance of our Waste activity and our Energy efficiency business. And in Japan, it was up 4.7% with strong performance of Water operations. Rest of Europe revenue was up 1%, excluding energy prices. In Central Europe, the impact of lower energy prices in district heating activity was partially offset by the very good Water activity. In Northern Europe, we registered an outstanding U.K. performance, good indexation and strong PFI activity with a weaker availability of 98%. Southern Europe enjoyed strong commercial and Water activity and improved tariff indexation. Finally, France and Hazardous Waste Europe. After a difficult 2023, we're turning the tide. Revenue grew by 2.7%, an improvement after only 1.4% in 2023, thanks to good performance in Water and Waste. We also initiated profitability enhancement actions in France with a strong commercial focus and very specific efficiency targets with quick returns. As a result, France EBITDA is up 5% in Q1. I'm on Slide 26. And you can see the main trend by activity that I will detail in the next slide. Water and Waste enjoyed a very good work in Q1 as we expected and are fueling the revenue and the EBITDA growth of the group. And we review our activities one by one and I'll start with Water on Slide 27, our largest activity, representing 40% of our revenue. Water business grew by 6.5%, driven actually by volume/commerce, plus 3%; and pricing, plus 3.6% thanks to, first, good volumes especially in Central Europe, plus 4.2%; Morocco, plus 2.4%; and France, plus 0.5%; continued favorable tariff indexation in France, for example, plus 4.5%; and in Central Europe, high-single digits in average. The quarter was, of course, marked by the signing of the new SEDIF contract for 12 years, which Estelle already detailed. In regulated water, in particular, in the U.S., volumes were up 3% and we concluded several favorable rate case negotiations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. And in Chile, for Aguas Sandinas, volumes were stable and we have continued favorable price indexation. Q1 was also marked by an outstanding Water Technology performance, in particular, the membrane business with increased sales of our AERO Products, the project business with the beginning of the Samsung (KS: 005930 ) contract and the St. Louis sludge project, both in the U.S., and the chemical products with strong volumes and price increases. The commercial activity remained very strong, and we have a very large pipeline of projects ahead of us. As Estelle highlighted, we have just booked a very large desalination project in Dubai for $320 million that will continue to fuel the growth of Water Tech. I'm moving to Slide 28 on Waste. Waste activities grew at a faster pace than in previous quarter by 5.5% compared to 3.4% in 2023, thanks to continued pricing power, improved volumes in Europe and good commercial momentum in Australia and Latin America. To take a few examples. In Europe, the U.K. had a very good start to the year with very strong PFI and also C&I performance. In Germany, we had a strong commercial activity and we stabilized the volumes. France was better than last year in terms of volumes and also in terms of profitability. We managed our electricity from our sales well, thanks to our hedging policy with selling prices higher than last year. In Australia, the activity remained well oriented with the start of new municipal contracts and good volumes. Recycled prices at only minus 0.7% impact as the main drop of recycled prices happened in the second part of 2022. And our prices are more or less stabilized. Hazardous Waste remained well oriented in almost all our geographies, and we continue to experience good pricing power in the U.S. Finally, on Slide 29, Energy activity decreased by 16.5% due to energy prices and the milder weather. Intrinsic energy growth was 1.1%. Thanks to our business model with index tariff and energy prices essentially passed through and thanks to our hedging policy, we have been able to protect our results. Energy EBITDA was quite stable in Q1 and should remain stable in the full year at a very high level. Weather was again unfavorable due to a very mild winter in Central Europe with an impact of minus 1%. On our district heating business, as expected, we continued to benefit from heat price increases by the regulators in Central Europe as there is a lag effect. We also benefited from the ramp-up of our very large district heating contract in Tashkent. On the electricity side, we benefited from our hedging policy, which enabled us to mitigate the market price evolution. We also started new high-efficiency cogeneration with higher EBITDA, such as Braunschweig in Germany and [indiscernible] in Czech Republic. And we have more to come with Poznan in Poland in 2025. Finally, we signed significant new energy efficiency contracts in Belgium, Italy, the Middle East and Hong Kong. I'm now on Page 30, where you have our usual EBITDA bridge. We delivered a strong EBITDA growth of 5.7% like-for-like, fueled by the combination of the solid underlying revenue growth, strong efficiencies and synergies ahead of schedule. In detail, scope included the disposal of Sade from March 1 and the integration of bolt-on assets in Germany. ForEx negative impact reached minus €58 million, mainly in Latin America. Energy and recyclate impact was slightly negative, minus 1.8%, as we expected. EBITDA for Energy business was quite stable in Q1. Weather had an impact of minus 1.2% with the mild winter in Central Europe. EBITDA intrinsic growth was, therefore, fueled by the following effect: a more robust commerce and volume impact for plus 3.6%, continuous strong net efficiency and synergies for 5.1%. The synergy delivery continues to be ahead of target, reaching €42 million in Q1 and €357 million accumulated since the closing of the acquisition of Suez, which is remarkable. Moving to Slide 31. Let's see how the EBITDA increase is fueling the current EBIT, which is growing very strongly by 11.1% at €833 million. Renewable expense of €72 million are comparable with Q1 last year. Amortization, OFA and provision at €731 million is slightly down compared to 2023 with amortization slightly up due to the ramp-up of our contract in Uzbekistan and less impairment and provision than in 2023. JVs amounts to €22 million compared to €28 million last year, essentially due to a one-off in 2023. Our net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. CapEx remained quite stable and included €95 million of decarbonization CapEx with good progress on our Poznan project and €43 million of Hazardous Waste new projects, particularly in the U.S., in the Middle East and in Germany. The quarterly increase in net financial debt was due first to the seasonal reversal of working capital that was slightly higher than last year due to unfavorable calendar effects. It will not impact the free cash flow delivery of the year. We had higher payments in Q1 to water authorities in Water France and in CO2 products in Central Europe. And second, to the €200 million hybrid debt final repayment after the renewal of our €600 million hybrid debt in November last year. Our solid investment-grade rating has just been confirmed by S&P and Moody's (NYSE: MCO ) with a stable outlook. Moving to Slide 33. To conclude, we, of course, confirm our ambitious guidance for 2024. Revenue, continued solid organic growth. For EBITDA, organic growth between 5% to 6%. More than €350 million of efficiency gains. More than €400 million cumulated synergies at the end of 2024. Current net income above €1.5 billion, which means a double-digit growth compared to 2023. Leverage ratio below 3x. And as usual, our dividend will grow in line with our current EPS. Thank you for your attention.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you, Claude. And now we are ready to take your questions.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arthur Sitbon from Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ).

Arthur Sitbon: So the first one would be on the synergies and cost savings. I see that the synergies in Q1 are quite strong compared to what you expect for the full year. So I was wondering if we should expect a normalization there in the next 3 quarters or if it's just that potentially you're going to deliver strong synergies on the year. And on pretty much the same topic, on cost savings, the retention rate as well seems higher than usual, close to 45%. Was there anything unusual happening in Q1? Or is it what we can expect for the whole year? So that's the first question. The second one is that you talk -- while it's been several months now that you talk a lot about your booster activities and your stronghold activities. I was wondering if there is any action that you may consider to accelerate the shift of your business profile towards more booster activities and a bit less stronghold to potentially accelerate the overall group growth profile of Veolia.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Two very different questions, but in a way, they very much summarize 2 of the 3 levers of our value creation, be it growth and efficiency and delivery on that. So starting with synergies and cost savings. So yes, we've over-delivered in the first quarter. As usual, we will go on as fast as we can in delivering the synergies. Our commitment remains to deliver €500 million in 4 years. So at least €400 million by the end of this year. And we'll do it as quick as we can. And I guess in terms of behind figures what is there, there are quite different things throughout the various years. The first year was very much the HQ type of savings. Typically, I don't know, real estate has emerged and 2 HQs in the same city in one same building. Then we moved to, say, more operational things. Typically, I don't know, in Australia, rebooting of trucks. As you know, in Australia, we had like to 2 kind of similar in size activities in Waste, both in Suez and Veolia, which we've combined and so it's very operational. And I guess now we can see the benefits of the merger within the Water Tech zone, which was slightly delayed compared to, say, the Australia example and which I anticipate to go on for the next quarter. So no slowing down to anticipate in terms of the overall €500 million over 4 years, which we'll deliver as quick as we can. And I guess, as you know, I'm kind of repeating myself on that one. I like to deliver on our promise and this is my priority as time goes. And in those days of uncertainties in the world, I think to be able to stick to the plan is something which has some merit. In terms of cost savings, apart from synergies, who are traditional, shall I say, because it's become traditional to have cost savings, €300 million, which we've already enhanced from €200 million or €250 million, which was the initial type of figures to now €350 million per year. I'm very happy that on top of the traditional cost-savings plans we have throughout all the business units of Veolia throughout the world, we are adding specific ones depending on the specific situation. And typically, I've highlighted briefly in my introduction words the France-specific action plan. France hasn't been -- I mean has been all right, but not great last year. And that's why we've launched a specific action plan, which is starting to bear fruit. Same applies with what I mentioned on exiting some underperforming contracts like the one in Canada. So I guess, we're trying to be as agile as we can and we have been. And I guess, the next few years will be probably more of the same, plus, say, GenAI, typically, to fuel new ideas. And I tend to say kind of forever in Veolia, we always find new sources of efficiencies. In terms of your second question on growth, we've announced our strategic plan a few weeks ago. And I guess your question is very much aligned with the strategic direction I've highlighted a few weeks ago, which is booster and stronghold, both are important. In terms of stronghold, they account for roughly 70% of our revenue, the booster 30%. But in terms of investments, it will be the opposite way around and we expect the growth to come 70% from the boosters and only 30% from the stronghold. So I guess we put our money where our mouth is. And we already make a priority of those boosters, which doesn't mean that we forget the stronghold. And they are very important as well. Why is that so? They are kind of the foundations on which we anchor, we build the boosters. If I give one example, without our, I would say, classical historic activities of dry waste and municipal water, we wouldn't be able to deliver the bioenergy production from waste or from wastewater, just to give one example, which is a booster. So the two are really intertwined very much. And I guess when from the stronghold activities, the idea is to maintain our customer happy and to follow some growth. But say, it would be typically inflation plus 1%, what we expect from those type of activities. For the boosters, we're talking 5% to 10% or mid- to high single-digit growth, as we said. And I'm very happy that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter where our boosters have grown like exactly in this range and well above the average of the group in the first quarter. That's for the activities. And for the geographies, the same applies. We said we are very happy with our history and geography, so France and Europe typically. But we will have a higher rate of growth in the U.S., in the Middle East and Australia and that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter. Claude mentioned the Australian growth, the American one as well. And each of those 3 geographic boosters have grown by above 6%, and as we've seen in Water Tech, it's even 15%. So I guess, the priorities are translating into figures now and will be in the next few years. But I guess -- no, I was about to summarize in one more because my answer was very long. I guess it's resilience and growth, which we are aiming at delivering. Resilience comes from the strongholds. The growth comes from the boosters mainly, although you have a little bit of both in both activities, which means that when you say that a company like Veolia, which is long-term contracted activities, infrastructure-like in many ways, is able to deliver in the first quarter 3.9% in of revenue growth, I'm very happy about these results. And it's very, very much a testimony to your question about how to enhance growth. I think the figures demonstrate that.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Patel from Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).

Ajay Patel: Thank you very much for the presentation. I think my first sort of set of questions is on this teaser slide, on Slide 19, $200 billion estimated market. I don't think I, when I look at that, have the full appreciation of how Veolia's placed. I know that you have the range of technologies, but if you were to try to cater to that market, what will it take in regards to CapEx investment? What do you have already on the ground that can help to that solution? And what potentially could you invest to take advantage of this opportunity? Just helping me sort of translate the big sort of number that you presented to actually nuts and bolts, somewhat sort of lower down. And then I guess the second one is more granular, but just -- with an awful amount of wet weather, I just wondered potentially what could that mean in terms of the impact on water usage? Any sort of commentary around that would be helpful.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Sorry, I haven't understood your second question well enough.

Claude Laruelle: Total usage.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Water usage. Okay, sorry, due to PFAS, you mean, or is it a totally separate question?

Ajay Patel: Sorry, separate question. The second one is separate, but just the first one, give us more on this PFAS. Does it sound like a massive opportunity? It's just it doesn't feel -- it doesn't -- I can't really frame it in my mind in regards to Veolia, yes.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Okay. Good. So two different questions on PFAS, which is the Page 19 you were referring to. I guess a few things on that one. This is about anticipation, positioning, patents and technologies and let me explain why. PFAS, as you know, is quite an emerging market. That's why the numbers I've mentioned are publicized by third parties. As you know, they are our first estimate. But as I said, the legislation in the U.S. dates back from 3 weeks ago or something like that and it's still evolving and in Europe it's the same. So it's difficult to assess with and to answer very, very precisely to your question. But there is a unique potential market, which we know will be very, very sizable. What we know as well is it's going to take a little bit of time because legislation translates into projects and then into delivery and then into margin for Veolia. So a little bit of it will see in this GreenUp plan and probably much more in the one after, given some of the time to deliver on those. But the new opportunity is huge and we are uniquely positioned, that's for certain. How is that so? I detailed that in our deep dive in the U.S. a few weeks ago. So if you want to know more, I encourage you to watch the replay. But in a nutshell, PFAS, say, you can find it in many places in water as well as in soil and sites that you have to decontaminate. So typically, if you see a map of the world, a map of the U.S. we've shown, a map of Europe, you see PFAS pretty much everywhere where you have large industrial chemical parks as well as every single airport and airbase, basically. And you can see a map where you have PFAS. How do you treat those? You have usually to concentrate and this is with membranes or resins. It happens that we are #1 in those technologies with Water Tech business. Then you have to, say, treat as in -- I was about to say destroy and cut into pieces. And this is with our high-temperature incinerator, which typically can do that. High-temperature incinerator, meaning 150 degrees Celsius, just to give you an idea what I mean by high temperature, which our Hazardous Waste business. So in a way, this is an example where we have the municipal water activity, the Water Technologies like in resins and membranes as well as the Hazardous Waste business, and we are the leaders in every single of those three businesses, actually #1 in each of the three actually in the world and in the various geographies I've just mentioned. So in a way, we have competitors, of course, in each of those segments. I really believe in each of those segments we are the best. But what's very unique is our ability to offer the full range, the end-to-end solution. And I cannot see anyone offering the end-to-end solution. And why is it so important? It means that for customers, you would need resin, in another one you would need membrane, for the third one you have go directly to a high-temperature incinerator or whatever because every single situation is different if you talk about an airport pollution, if you talk about a refinery or if you talk about water. So this is really an example of an ecology of solutions, which is, Mr. Customer, you have a problem. We manage to design a solution to fit your needs and we have the full portfolio from end-to-end again. So difficult to assess how speed -- how quick, I guess, this market will translate into our figures because, again, the legislation is very, very recent. But given what I said, we know which we have a unique opportunity here to offer what we do very well and what we're the leader of. We already have some contracts we signed because some customers have anticipated the legislation in a way. So it's typically the Department of Defense in Australia or some specific customers in the U.S. and it even started in Europe, so we have already had a few contracts. They are not significant in numbers as in we're talking millions of euros or dozens of millions, no more, so far. But it's moving super, super quick. On the second question, which is the water usage. If your question is about billing between weather and water usage, I would like to try and understand better your question to be able to answer more precisely if you can. Was that restriction of water -- water restriction you mean or water quality? Or tell me.

Ajay Patel: I was just thinking the weather seems to have been quite wet. And to what extent could that impact your Waste volumes in the second half of the year or over the remaining quarters so that it could be a benefit to you?

Estelle Brachlianoff: I guess the Waste volume, you probably mean the Water volume?

Ajay Patel: Water volume. I'm sorry.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Yes, yes. Just -- Okay. So you always have a little bit of weather impact in Veolia. That's why we have shown you on the various bridge that Claude has what we call the interesting growth, which is the self-help, if you want, from growing our activities and efficiency. And we've had a negative weather effect in the winter, so we may have a positive or negative weather in the summer. I can tell you that whatever is the summer like, I commit on delivering on the guidance I repeated. So that's the usual one. Second -- so that's the short-term answer. So we can confirm the guidance, whatever. The second answer is on the, I guess, midterm trends. It's fair to say that the summary of '22 in France, the summer of '23 in the U.K. and I could go on like that and in Spain and so on and so forth means that it was such a shocker for municipalities and populations and industries alike that even when it rains, the push for solutions, be the reduction of [indiscernible] or reuse of wastewater and all the rest of it is still very much top of the list of our customers. So it's good news that it has rained, so the underground water are now a bit more full than they were a few weeks ago. But I can tell you, our customers are still very, very, very adamant to find solution because everybody has perfectly understood that this type of event is here to stay and even to reinforce because it's the first consequence of global warming, basically. A testimony to that is the survey we've conducted with Elabe in 24 countries with 26,000 people in the world, which we've just released the results a few weeks ago, where the population -- everyone in the world basically has understood that we need solution as in now. And I can tell you whatever the weather is like, this is here to stay. So we are on a megatrend, which I'm very confident is here to stay because it's pushed the demand from the population itself.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Olly Jeffery from Deutsche Bank (ETR: DBKGn ).

Olly Jeffery: So a couple of questions. First one, I'd just like to think about how you're seeing the rest of the year in terms of the outlook for Waste growth in China and Europe, given the economic picture is looking slightly better for those regions. So are you seeing any evidence of that yet because I know that in China, obviously, it's been slightly depressed for your business there. And the other question I have was around just the specifics within the DNA. So industrial capital gains and net provisions are up €31 million versus €10 million last year. Can you just explain what's driving that, please? And my last question is for the full year is €100 million FX headwind at the EBITDA level still the right order of magnitude? Or have things improved a little bit with the movement in the Chilean peso recently?

Estelle Brachlianoff: Sorry, I don't think I heard well the third question. Okay. EBITDA to EBIT, okay, sorry.

Claude Laruelle: On the first one, the rest of the year. So we see no change in the Waste activities. So the Waste activities, as you can see, has been well performing in the start of the year, plus 5.5% in terms of revenue. And in April, we have the same -- and the start of the May, we have the same trend as in Q1. So we are starting the year very well on the Waste activity. And so far, so good. The current trending is the same as we speak, as what we have seen in Q1. And for China, this is one of your question. We had -- the China solid waste was better than the start of the year, especially on plastic recycling. So we had a slightly better momentum in China. In terms of quality of earnings, if this is your question, and the EBITDA to EBIT transmission. As I said in Q1, we have slightly more amortization than last year with the ramp-up of the Tashkent contract, so a little bit more depreciation and amortization. On the provision side, the main topic was a provision that we had to take last year to cover the risk for a contract ending for around €20 million, and we had no such risk to cover in Q1 2024, which is good news. And on the other side, for the JVs, we had a positive one-off in 2023 and no such thing in 2024. So if you look at EBITDA, EBITDA has increased by €50 million. And it translates directly into EBIT level at €55 million, so the same amount if you compare to the EBITDA evolution and the EBIT evolution.

Estelle Brachlianoff: And just to complement Claude's answer on the first question. As we've said, we are 85%, we think something like that, immune to macro, which means that, in a way, I would differentiate a little bit Veolia's result from the GDP results and how the economy is going to countries you mentioned. In a way, I can comment on China GDP, but I'd rather comment on Veolia growth in Europe or in China, which were your two questions. And again, we are -- we have some very limited impact of the GDP, say, the 15%. But more interestingly, there is a part of it which is more commerce. And it's fair to say in some geographies, it's difficult for us to distinguish. Say, the Waste volume is a little bit up in the first quarter as you've seen by 1-point-something percent, 1.2%. And part of it is probably the economy doing a little bit better, and part of it is us being better than the competition. How do I split both? You know what? It's very difficult to say. And we've seen in some geographies, our competitors complaining and us being relatively happy because our job is to try, and again, like win valuable business and not only just to follow what the economy tells us. China being a good example, we've put a specific action plan in place. So we are not waiting for the rebound of the industry in China. We've put some action plan in place. So EBITDA is on the up, although revenue is not. I mean, it's kind of flat minus, something like that. But we have the EBITDA on the up because again I would distinguish the macro picture and whether Veolia delivers from it.

Olly Jeffery: That's clear. And just following up on the last question on the FX impact. I think before, you've spoken about €100 million for the full year at the EBITDA level. Is that still the right level to think about? And what should we think about the net income line because obviously a lot of that comes out through minorities. It might be helpful just to clarify on that bit, too.

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So for ForEx impact, we said between €70 million and €80 million if the currency stays at the same level, Olly. And the impact that net income will be super small. So whatever the ForEx, we can fully confirm that the net income will be above €1.5 billion at year-end.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jenny Ping from Citi.

Jenny Ping: I've got two questions, please. Just firstly, just going back to the PFAS point, can I ask what is the EPA regulation in terms of the removal rate because my understanding is that it's quite difficult for total removal of any PFAS substances in the water. And then secondly, linked to that, if I can also ask whether you guys have your own proprietary technology, i.e., competitive edge for the removal process, that would be great. And then just alongside of that, if I can ask for a bit more color around the recyclate prices and commodities movements that you've seen recently. Normally, you have the chart in the back of your pack, which shows the movements in commodity prices and recyclates, but I don't think it's there. So if you can give some commentary around that would be great.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you. So on PFAS, I would -- again, sorry, I encourage you to have a look at our replay on the U.S. deep dive, which will explain the whole detail of the EPA legislation, which had been released a few days before we've done this deep dive. I won't go into very much detail. We had two different sets of legislation so far, I mean, if I call EPA legislation, it's more standard than legislation, as such. The first one was on potable water and the second one was more on polluted soil and such, if you want, called [indiscernible]. And in both cases, you're right, it's very difficult to talk about total renewable. So there is a list of specific PFAS because, as you know, PFAS is a family of products, some of them being very likely [indiscernible] some of them very, very likely not. And it's not for me to decide. It's the sanitary and health authorities which decide that. And It has translated into a specific list of a few PFAS, where the combined pollution level, if you want, has to be detected below a certain threshold. And I guess, so just to give you a metaphor. The threshold is very small, but it's not 0 because, as you said, the total renewable is difficult. But it's so small, it's the equivalent of the size of a sugar cube in the middle of an Olympic swimming pool, just to give you the idea of the type of threshold the legislation has said will be -- have to be implemented in the next 5 years. Do we have our own technology? Yes, we do and they are patented. Again, resin, patented; membrane, patented; and very unique as well set of technologies in the high-temperature incinerator, which are above 1,100 degrees, as I mentioned. So yes, it's patented technologies and quite unique. And as you know, in those three, we are #1 player in the world, #1 player in Water Tech in the U.S. As well and #2 in the Hazardous Waste, so just to mention the U.S. And same applies with Europe, we are #1 in Water Tech and #1 in Hazardous Waste in Europe just the same. So yes, we have our own technologies to treat those. But as I mentioned earlier on, it's not only our technology, it's a set of technologies and the broadness of the end-to-end solution, combining the Water Tech, the Hazardous Waste, which makes us very unique. In terms of recyclate price and commodities, Claude, do you want to comment?

Claude Laruelle: So recyclate, the main topic for us is the paper and cardboard. What we are seeing in the -- you know it has dropped a lot, as I said, in the second part of 2022. After, we have seen a low price since -- during the course of 2023. We have seen a slightly up movement in Q1, especially in the month of March, which is really encouraging for the rest of the year. So we see a movement up in recyclates as we speak.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So it's -- but it's a limited one. So I guess our job is to deliver the result irrespective of the commodities price in a way, be it recyclates or be it energy, as I mentioned in my introduction speech. And the plastic price is, I guess, average low. So I guess do we have a potential for improvement in the next few years? Yes, we do. The price released still relatively low as we speak. When is it going to happen? I won't make any bet on that because it's always difficult to predict any commodities, but our commitment is on delivering on our guidance.

Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Alexandre Roncier from Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ).

Alexandre Roncier: I've got two, please. The first one is just a follow-up on the EBITDA to EBIT bridge. I think in your press release, you mentioned capital gains. So that was just to confirm the size of them, and if anything material was coming out of Sade for the quarter? And then the second one is I was looking at your free cash flow, and obviously, there's some phasing quarter-over-quarter and within the year. But I think you mentioned in your press release again some disbursement from carbon. And I was just wondering really the movements there, given that carbon prices are quite much lower year-over-year. And I would have expected perhaps lower by given the mild winter in your district heating business. So maybe if you can talk about the different driving forces there or if you were maybe a bit more tactical as other industrial players have been, I think, within the market for carbon buying.

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So on the capital gain that was very minimal because, as you know, on the EBIT level we record only the industrial capital gains, so that was only a few millions. So nothing relevant in terms of capital gains for the EBITDA to EBIT translation. In terms of free cash flow, in terms of -- and Sade capital gain will be below EBIT and will be released during the H1 results, but it's a positive one, I can confirm. In terms of free cash flow and the CO2. So it's a matter of calendar. So as I said, it's just a calendar effect. In CO2, as you know, we have a hedging policy, the same hedging policy in terms of CO2 as what we have on energy. Because we don't want to take market risk, so we hedge when we sell the energy in the market, we hedge the CO2 in the meantime. So we have a CO2 price, which is slightly above the market today, but we are buying CO2 on the market for the years to come and that will be also good news for our Energy business in 2025 and in 2026. And in terms of payments, it's just, as I said, the calendar effect Q1 versus the end of the year. So no impact on the delivery of free cash flow regarding this calendar effect.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Rodriguez from Kepler.

Juan Rodriguez: I have two in my side, if I may. The first one is, again, coming back on working capital and this seasonal, but increasing effect. I just want to confirm that you're expecting the end of the year towards normalization and relatively flat? And the second on this working cap is on the higher CO2 quotas. I want to confirm that it does not include U.K. as there was kind -- has been a recent article signaling a possible cost increase on incinerators in the country. So this is the first one -- kind of 1.2 question. And the second one is on acquisition. So if you can give us more color on the acquisition price and valuation of Hofmann in Germany and any color as well on the price evaluation of the Uniper CGT assets in Hungary will be helpful.

Claude Laruelle: So I'll start with the working capital. So no topic about the U.K. So it's not a topic at all on the working capital. And in terms of -- yes, we will reverse the working capital at year-end as usual, Juan. It's -- and we know that we start always with Q1 with a stronger negative working capital and it's always reversed progressively in Q3 and Q4. So no change regarding working capital for Veolia. Estelle...

Estelle Brachlianoff: Yes. On the others, so as you know, the U.K. CO2 for incineration, which was your second question, we're talking 2028, if, so going into the ETS scheme. So nothing to do with neither this year nor the years of the GreenUp plan. But in anticipation, in a way, we knew it were likely to come. Hence, we've started a few projects to capture CO2 from our incinerator, which is a very specific CO2, as I explained in London, actually following a question I had on that one because it's biogenic CO2, which is in a way that kind of, let's call it, the good CO2 as opposed to the bad CO2, which is a non-biogenic one. So no impact at all to expect. And by the way, the various costs will be bear-ed eventually by the municipalities in the end, not by Veolia. But we want to help, and therefore, we've launched a few projects. And you can see a press release in the U.K. about CO2 capture and storage and so on and so forth. In terms of the Uniper and off-line prices, there is a reason why we don't publish the price. And usually, it's because the sellers don't want us to. And I guess you can see that it's usually good news when the sellers doesn't want to publish the price of an acquisition made by Veolia. For us, I mean, good news for us. I guess, I will stay there, but highly value creative. So I think it's a very good example of, what I call, the third pillar of our value creation, which is, I guess, the optimization of the balance sheet and the portfolio of activities while constantly reviewing the plus and the minuses. And on those two, which are on the acquisition side, quick value creation because it's synergistic in both cases with our existing activities, in one case in Germany recycling; and the other one, flexibility in Hungary, which we do already have activities in Hungary in the same type of things. So value creation, relatively quick. I would say, a little bit plug and play, if you allow me the metaphor. So quite good illustration of that. So it's going to be value creation relatively quickly.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Palliez from CIBC Market Solutions -- sorry, CIC Market Solutions.

Arnaud Palliez: I have just one remaining follow-up question on the changes in scope. Can you give us the impact on full year revenue and margin for the acquisitions of Uniper and Hofmann -- or the deal with Uniper. And a reminder also about Morocco, Lydec, what can be the impact on annual sales and margin? And the same question on the disposal side regarding the Italian water concessions.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So you made a quite a long list on the plus side, Uniper and Hofmann. On the minus side, Italia and maybe the Lydec one. So if I summarize all that is included in our guidance for the year, obviously. And whatever the date I'm going to briefly detail, I guess it won't change our €1.5 billion net result target, I would say, in absolute value irrespective of the scope for the end of the year. I think that's the important bit. So you have the plus and the minuses compensated. And altogether, of course, we expect all that to create value and be a plus. Uniper is not closed yet. We're talking about later in the year, probably the autumn, something like that. Hofmann, it will be in the account, I think, it varies, a little bit in Q1 and there will be the rest in Q2 onwards. Lydec, I guess, no impact on net results because it's very, very, I guess, limiting in terms of net results contribution. And in terms of Sade, in a way, it has a large impact on revenue, but not on margins because, as I said, we're talking about an EBITDA percentage of roughly around 5%. So it's a good business. And the reason why we've sold it is not the 5%, it's a good performance for a construction type of business. But we're not keen to keep construction businesses, as we've highlighted a few times. And Italia, it was not consolidated because it was a series of minority shares where we didn't have an operational impact on and that's exactly why we sold. So it's a very different situation and very small.

Claude Laruelle: Very small EBIT impact, nonsignificant. Absolutely nonsignificant at group level. So very happy.

Estelle Brachlianoff: That's why all that -- so yes, so all that will again contribute to the €1.5 billion target at current.

Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Philippe Ourpatian from ODDO BHF.

Philippe Ourpatian: Yes. I have two follow-up questions. The first one is concerning ForEx. You confirmed a €70 million, €80 million impact. But just could we have, as it's very difficult and mainly linked to Argentina where the situation is a little bit troubled view from Europe, could you just have a kind of sensitivity about what's going to happen if, let's say, your forecast in terms of Argentinian pesos is not exactly aligned with the figure at the end of the year as you are accounting through inflationary-trained accounting principle. It means that you are taking, let's say, the last day of the quarter or the full year. And just to have a kind of sensitivity concerning the main LatAm ForEx impact at the EBITDA level, please? That's the first one. And the second one is in the Slide 30, you mentioned some good retention rate. When I'm taking the €33 million net efficiencies, let's say, and the €88 million on the gross value, it seems that we are always around the 50%. Is this means that we are starting to have a better retention rate in terms of efficiency versus the past? Or is it something specific to Q1?

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So maybe on the first one, the best guess that we can make, Philippe, is to take the actual assumption with the actual exchange rate and have a projection on the full year. Argentinian business is very small and EBITDA is very small, so it will not have additional significant impact when you have the full year with the hyperinflation in December resetting the entire year of ForEx impact. So because it's small, we don't expect this to be at the end of the year material in terms of ForEx impact in Argentina. That's what we see today.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So on the retention rate, which is your second question, it made me realize that I didn't answer on that question already asked a few minutes ago. Yes, you're right, 38 divided by 88 is now 43% than 50%. But nevertheless, it's on the upper part of our range, which we said is always between 30% and 50% depending on the quarters. So does it mean that we'll stay at this type of range as in 43%? You know, 30% to 50% is traditional for us, so I guess the middle part of the range is a good assumption for me going forward. And the specificity of Q1 was more what I mentioned on the Water Tech, which was really, I guess, volume-based and growth-based rather than, I guess, SG&A, which at times necessitates a bit of cost to be able to extract efficiencies. So I guess the retention rate depends more on the type of efficiency than anything else. When you're talking SG&A at times, you have a bit to pay to get them extracted. Therefore, the net is a little bit on the lower range. When you talk about, say, purchasing, it's more on the upper end of the range. And the mix makes it different from quarter to the other. And the upper part of the range is due, again, mainly on the Water Tech efficiency plan in the first quarter.

Philippe Ourpatian: Yet in fact, my question was also linked to the GreenUp strategy. It means that are you forecasting to have a better, maybe, retention rate due to this, let's say, new strategy more -- mainly focused on having additional value, making more complex, let's say, technical contract and so on? That's also part of my question.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So I guess, the way to see the GreenUp objective is €300 million per year plus the second part of the synergies, of course, plus the top line growth, all that fueling EBITDA. So in a way, what is important for me is really the 6% average basically growth of EBITDA, which we've published which is 8% -- sorry, €8 billion EBITDA target for 2027. I guess this is more the figure because you have pluses and minuses. Of course, if we can retain more in efficiency plan, we will. But we can have weather impact as well as we've seen in this quarter or not great commodities, so I guess you have pluses and minuses. That's why the way to see it is really the target of EBITDA and the target even more so in net results, which is 10% on average over the duration of the plan. I guess that's what the attention is focused on. And usually at Veolia, when we have a specific things happening, we react with an extra specific plan as we've done particularly in France, which is starting to bear fruit. So I guess, instead of talking about average of retention, I'd rather [indiscernible] on, again, net results over the duration of the plan, which is what we are focusing our attention upon with EPS in line in terms of growth.

Operator: Thank you. There seems to be no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brachlianoff for final closing comments.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you very much for attending this conference call. And again, very good result, which helps me to see 2024 with great confidence and confirm our objective for the year and a very good start of our GreenUp plan. Thank you.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Veolia Q1 2024 Key Figures Conference Call with Estelle Brachlianoff, CEO; and Claude Laruelle, CFO. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded May 14, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Estelle Brachlianoff. Please go ahead.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this conference call to present Veolia's results for the first quarter of '24. And with me is Claude Laruelle, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter results are, once again, excellent. They are perfectly in line with our annual objective and enable us to start 2024 with great confidence and fully confirm our guidance for the year. And I'm on Slide 4 where you would see sales came to €11.5 billion, up 3.9%, excluding energy price, which are essentially pass-through for us, as you know. EBITDA has increased by substantial 5.7% on a like-for-like basis to €1.624 billion and current EBIT by 11.1% to €843 million. Net financial debt is well under control and in line with our target of leverage ratio below 3x at year-end. These results are the fruit of our unique positioning as the world's leader of environmental services, which, combined with the sustained effort and professional efficiency enables us to deliver both resilience and growth of our results. The last few months have confirmed the choices of our next strategic program, GreenUp, which, for instance, the critical importance for both cities and industries of deploying solutions to tackle water scarcity and onshore water quality, those challenges where Veolia has a leadership position, as you know. I'm on Slide 5. And you can see we registered very solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy price, fueled in particular by Water and Waste, which grew by 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Regarding Energy, as anticipated, lower energy price has weighted on our top line, but our Energy revenue has been flat, excluding the effect of energy price and has even grown by 1% if you exclude negative weather effect in the first quarter. As you know, our Energy margin as in EBITDA is well protected from the ups and downs of energy price, which showed again in the first quarter. Actually, we expect 2024 Energy EBITDA to remain at the high level we reached last year despite lower energy price. How is that so? Veolia is quite unique in the energy market since we operate in local energy only as we explained last January during our deep dive dedicated to energy. As I've said, we anticipated this, which is the reason why we have published our revenue growth, excluding energy price, each quarter since 2022 as they do not impact our performance. Energy is a profitable and growing activity for Veolia. Slide 6. In order to detail how we've delivered another quarter of very good results, I would like to start by briefly explaining Veolia's recipe for value creation, which lies in 3 key engines: top line growth, efficiency and capital allocation. Starting with revenue growth. We combined stronghold activities, which were very resilient essential services, infrastructure-like with three growth boosters, namely, water technologies and new solutions, hazardous waste treatment and bioenergies, flexibility and energy efficiency. Our stronghold activities enjoy security and high contract renewal rates. Anchored in those, our booster activities grew at mid- to high single-digit rates as they are driven by strong market trends and Veolia's unique positioning, water quality and scarcity, regulation to protect health and reshoring, just to mention a few. The second pillar of value creation is our strict management of operations and attention to delivery. Each year, we deliver €350 million of efficiency gains, which have been topped up by cost synergies of the Suez merger, an addition of €500 million over 5 years -- 4 years, sorry. The third pillar is our capital allocation. We target high value-creating projects or tuck-in acquisitions in line with our strategic priorities. So typically our 3 growth boosters, all the geographies in which we want to expand. Our internal rule is IRR above WACC plus 4% and ROCE above WACC after year 3 for these investments. Meanwhile, we constantly review our portfolio of assets to check if there is still some value creation ahead. If not or when the asset is not in line with our strategy, typically construction or FM activities or subscale presence, we may decide to sell. This value creation model is the backbone of our GreenUp plan with current net income growth of 10% per annum on average and the dividend growing in line with EPS and ROCE post-tax above 9% in 2027. I'm on Slide 8, and let me detail now each of those 3 pillars of value creation and the way they have translated into Q1 results, starting with top line growth. In Q1, we delivered solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, thanks to continued strong foundation with regards to indexation, pricing, contract renewal and new wins. In addition to a particularly strong performance in the Water Tech booster, both in delivery and new order book, up 50% in Q1 to €1.8 billion. In terms of geographies, Australia, the Middle East and the U.S., which you know are our growth boosters, performed particularly well, each of them above 6% growth, which is aligned with our ambition laid in our GreenUp plan. On Page 9, you have a focus on the performance of activities defined as stronghold in our GreenUp plan, which performed very well in Q1. Water municipal operations and Solid Waste revenue progressed very well, thanks to commercial momentum, better volumes, [indiscernible] indexation and continued pricing power. So 30% of our contracts, which are not indexed. District heating networks were flat, excluding energy price, due to mild weather in Central and Eastern Europe, but will have progressed otherwise. All registered strong commercial wins, notably the renewal of the SEDIF contract, which I'm very pleased with, as you would expect. As you know, and I'm now on Page 10, this contract provides water services for 4 million inhabitants in 132 municipalities around Paris for a total revenue of €4 billion over 12 years. We managed to renew this contract, thanks in particular to a series of very innovative solutions, which will make this contract a worldwide reference of water services of the 21st century with 10 world-firsts. These include the combination of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to treat all new pollutants from PFAS to pesticide residues or endocrine disruptors as well to AI to help improve network efficiency to 93%, just to mention a few. As you can see, innovation is really at the heart of what we do at Veolia. On Page 11, now we'll focus on the performance of our GreenUp booster activities in Q1. Water Technologies continued to perform excessively well in terms of sales, earnings and bookings. Revenue grew by 15% in all our lines of business within Water Tech, while booking increased by 50% to €1.8 billion, including another big success in desalination in Dubai at Hassyan. In local decarbonizing energy, we continue to grow in flexibility with a 430-megawatt assets acquired from Uniper in Hungary, which will complement our own asset -- set of assets in this country. As you know, with this promising and strategic market, which is critical to the grid given the development of renewables, and with this operation, Veolia now has 2.4 gigawatts of managed flexible electrical energy in Europe. Still in local decarbonizing energy. In France, we are installing a series of solar panels on our landfills, which will produce 300 megawatts of green electricity by 2027. On Slide 12, you can see a list of some of the bookings in Water Tech we have recorded in Q1 with several contracts in semiconductors or oil and gas. On the Hassyan desalination project, I'm very proud that we'll have, with this one, the most energy-efficient worldwide desalination in the world and not a small one because it will serve 2 million inhabitants. And actually, when I said energy-efficient, we have crossed the floor of 3-kilowatt hour per cubic meter of water produced, which seemed unreachable only 10 years ago and which is a 35% reduction compared to 10 years ago and even 5x lower than the project we designed 30 years ago. You can see with this example that Veolia innovation helps save energy, money and CO2. On Slide 14, now let's deep dive into our second lever of value creation, which is performance and efficiency. You can see on this slide our first quarter performance in terms of operating efficiency and synergies. In terms of efficiency, we achieved €88 million in gains, in line with our annual target of €350 million. I'm pleased to see the specific action plan launched in France late last year bear its first fruits in Q1. In addition, we have fixed or exited a few underperforming contracts, notably one in Canada. In terms of cost synergies derived from the Suez merger, we are ahead of schedule and have achieved €42 million in Q1, or cumulative of €357 million since the start of the merger with Suez. Safe to say that the efficiency program are now part of the DNA and will remain so, leveraging on our more than 3,000 plants and units worldwide. But we are constantly looking for new tools and new opportunities, such as GenAI now, which we have dozen tests underway as we speak. The last driver of our value creation is capital allocation where we were particularly active in Q1, and I'm on Slide 16. Our CapEx program continued at a sustained pace with ongoing projects to build new hazardous waste treatment facilities in the U.S., Germany and Saudi. All those projects will be commissioned in 2025 and will fuel growth and increase return in this activity, which is among the 3 boosters of our GreenUp plan. As you know, Hazardous Waste already accounts for 10% of group sales and we are the world leader present on all continents. In parallel, we continued the conversion plan of our coal-fired facilities with €95 million invested during the first quarter in Poland and the Czech Republic. We expect a double-digit return from our decarbonization CapEx and are already benefiting from the higher profitability of our new Braunschweig facility, which was converted last year. We have been quite active in terms of bolt-on acquisition as well from Uniper flexibility assets in Hungary to recycling activities in Germany. Those two tuck-ins are a perfect illustration of our business model as they complement our existing asset footprint perfectly and generate significant synergies from day 1. And on February 29, we completed the disposal of Sade, as this construction activity, mainly in France, was noncore and with an EBITDA margin of around 5% dilutive for the rest of the group. These very good results in Q1 confirms the strength of our business model, which we summarize on Slide 18. Veolia is very resilient as we provide social services, both to municipal and industrial clients, with full asset ownership and more than 90% of renewal contracts. 85% of sales are not exposed to the economic cycle. We are protected against inflation, thanks to contract indexation formulas and our pricing power as we've proven and sustained in the last 3 years. We enjoy leadership position in all our key countries, which has proven key to pricing power, in particular. We benefit from balanced geographical footprint with 40% outside Europe, of which more than $5 billion in the U.S., no country outside the U.S. with more than 10% of the group's capital employed. Of course, in addition to these strengths, Veolia enjoys growth thanks to supportive megatrends and the unique positioning as the world leader of environmental services. Water quality, water scarcity, socioeconomic challenges, hazardous waste treatment, decarbonization are here to stay and we are the key to enabling our customers to grow sustainably. To illustrate our unique positioning, I'm now on Slide 19, let me give this example of PFAS, which is the case in point. Thanks to our innovation and the set of patented technologies we've developed, which includes membranes and resins as well as high-temperature incineration, we are now ready to treat these emerging pollutants. The combination of our various businesses in Water Technologies, Water operations as well as Hazardous Waste enable us to offer an end-to-end solution. Our presence in the U.S. when those pollutants were first detected has helped us to anticipate and be ready to treat this pollutant in Europe now. And actually things are moving fast in PFAS. In the first quarter alone, we've seen in the U.S. two new regulations from the EPA, which represents an estimated market for remediation and solutions estimated to $250 billion in the U.S. alone. Veolia has already started to treat PFAS [indiscernible] with water in [indiscernible] water in France, in the U.S. and in Australia. So I'm now on Slide 20. Veolia is a unique global leader in environmental services, ideally positioned to address fast-growing demand trends across the globe from water scarcity to decarbonization and decontamination to protection and health as the case of PFAS strategy illustrates. Our international presence in 44 countries and in the top 3 niche of our key countries is a key success factor as much as our strongly engaged workforce. On Slide 21, the very strong Q1 results allow me to fully confirm our target for 2024 and are very much in line with our GreenUp objectives. The financial and nonfinancial objective of our strategic plan are summarized in this slide. They include current net income growth of an average of 10% per year with dividends growing in line with EPS. I now hand over to Claude who will detail the Q1 '24 results before we both dive to your questions. Claude?

Claude Laruelle: Thank you, Estelle, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm on Slide 23. And as Estelle already highlighted, our Q1 2024 results are, once again, remarkable and allow us to be very confident for the rest of the year. With €11.5 billion revenue, we experienced a good organic revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, driven by good commercial momentum and improved Water and Waste volumes, continued favorable indexation on our long-term contracts and price increases on nonindexed businesses. Taking into account the impact of lower energy prices, revenue was down by 1.7%, as expected, without impact on EBITDA. Thanks to the operating leverage and the good delivery of synergies, we enjoyed a solid organic EBITDA growth of 5.7% at €1.624 billion and a current EBIT growth of 11.1% at €843 million. Net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. You can also see on the slide the detailed ForEx impact, which were negative in Q1, minus €228 million at revenue level and minus €58 million at EBITDA level. Assuming the exchange rates remain at today's level, the full year impact at EBITDA level would be between €70 million and €80 million. As a reminder, as we operate in local currency, ForEx impacts are only translation and not transaction impacts. On Slide 24, you have our usual revenue bridge detailing the different effects and showing our top line intrinsic growth of 4.5% composed of commercial wins and pricing, those two green boxes on the right-hand side of the bridge. Looking at the full bridge in more details, what do we see? First, ForEx had a negative impact of minus 1.9%, mostly in Latin America. Second, scope impact is limited, minus 0.1%, after Sade disposal in February and a few tuck-ins. As a reminder, Sade is a construction business with low margin. For organic growth, we continued to enjoy solid growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, which is fueled by good commercial momentum, volume growth, strong growth activities, price and indexation increase in Water and Waste. The main item on the bridge is, of course, the lower energy prices for €679 million, with almost no impact on EBITDA. Recyclate prices have stabilized and the impact is insignificant in Q1 at revenue and EBITDA levels. The weather impact was unfavorable, minus 0.4%, compared to 2023, which was already mild. We experienced, in fact, the warmest winter over the last 30 years in Central Europe. Moving to Slide 25. You can see the revenue evolution by geographical segment and I start with Water Technologies, which delivered another very strong quarter, both in terms of revenue and bookings. Revenue are up 15% with sustained growth in all our business lines. And in terms of bookings, as Estelle said, we registered a record level of bookings of €1.8 billion, including more than €600 million in the U.S. In the Rest of the World, all regions performed very well. Notably, Australia had a very strong growth of 8.5%, thanks to good Waste performance, several contract wins, strict pricing discipline and good landfill volumes. Latin America grew double digits, thanks to good Waste volumes and pricing. Underlying activity was well oriented in Brazil, Chile and Colombia with several new contracts. To take a few, Las Salinas in Chile for soil remediation or Braskem biomass in Brazil. Africa/Middle East revenue was up 4%, thanks to strong business in Morocco and new energy efficiency contracts in the Middle East in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi. North America continued to enjoy solid Hazardous Waste performance and good Water activity. In Hazardous waste, for example, we benefited from a favorable mix effect and average prices are up 7%. In Asia, solid growth in Hong Kong, plus 10%, with a very strong performance of our Waste activity and our Energy efficiency business. And in Japan, it was up 4.7% with strong performance of Water operations. Rest of Europe revenue was up 1%, excluding energy prices. In Central Europe, the impact of lower energy prices in district heating activity was partially offset by the very good Water activity. In Northern Europe, we registered an outstanding U.K. performance, good indexation and strong PFI activity with a weaker availability of 98%. Southern Europe enjoyed strong commercial and Water activity and improved tariff indexation. Finally, France and Hazardous Waste Europe. After a difficult 2023, we're turning the tide. Revenue grew by 2.7%, an improvement after only 1.4% in 2023, thanks to good performance in Water and Waste. We also initiated profitability enhancement actions in France with a strong commercial focus and very specific efficiency targets with quick returns. As a result, France EBITDA is up 5% in Q1. I'm on Slide 26. And you can see the main trend by activity that I will detail in the next slide. Water and Waste enjoyed a very good work in Q1 as we expected and are fueling the revenue and the EBITDA growth of the group. And we review our activities one by one and I'll start with Water on Slide 27, our largest activity, representing 40% of our revenue. Water business grew by 6.5%, driven actually by volume/commerce, plus 3%; and pricing, plus 3.6% thanks to, first, good volumes especially in Central Europe, plus 4.2%; Morocco, plus 2.4%; and France, plus 0.5%; continued favorable tariff indexation in France, for example, plus 4.5%; and in Central Europe, high-single digits in average. The quarter was, of course, marked by the signing of the new SEDIF contract for 12 years, which Estelle already detailed. In regulated water, in particular, in the U.S., volumes were up 3% and we concluded several favorable rate case negotiations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. And in Chile, for Aguas Sandinas, volumes were stable and we have continued favorable price indexation. Q1 was also marked by an outstanding Water Technology performance, in particular, the membrane business with increased sales of our AERO Products, the project business with the beginning of the Samsung (KS:005930) contract and the St. Louis sludge project, both in the U.S., and the chemical products with strong volumes and price increases. The commercial activity remained very strong, and we have a very large pipeline of projects ahead of us. As Estelle highlighted, we have just booked a very large desalination project in Dubai for $320 million that will continue to fuel the growth of Water Tech. I'm moving to Slide 28 on Waste. Waste activities grew at a faster pace than in previous quarter by 5.5% compared to 3.4% in 2023, thanks to continued pricing power, improved volumes in Europe and good commercial momentum in Australia and Latin America. To take a few examples. In Europe, the U.K. had a very good start to the year with very strong PFI and also C&I performance. In Germany, we had a strong commercial activity and we stabilized the volumes. France was better than last year in terms of volumes and also in terms of profitability. We managed our electricity from our sales well, thanks to our hedging policy with selling prices higher than last year. In Australia, the activity remained well oriented with the start of new municipal contracts and good volumes. Recycled prices at only minus 0.7% impact as the main drop of recycled prices happened in the second part of 2022. And our prices are more or less stabilized. Hazardous Waste remained well oriented in almost all our geographies, and we continue to experience good pricing power in the U.S. Finally, on Slide 29, Energy activity decreased by 16.5% due to energy prices and the milder weather. Intrinsic energy growth was 1.1%. Thanks to our business model with index tariff and energy prices essentially passed through and thanks to our hedging policy, we have been able to protect our results. Energy EBITDA was quite stable in Q1 and should remain stable in the full year at a very high level. Weather was again unfavorable due to a very mild winter in Central Europe with an impact of minus 1%. On our district heating business, as expected, we continued to benefit from heat price increases by the regulators in Central Europe as there is a lag effect. We also benefited from the ramp-up of our very large district heating contract in Tashkent. On the electricity side, we benefited from our hedging policy, which enabled us to mitigate the market price evolution. We also started new high-efficiency cogeneration with higher EBITDA, such as Braunschweig in Germany and [indiscernible] in Czech Republic. And we have more to come with Poznan in Poland in 2025. Finally, we signed significant new energy efficiency contracts in Belgium, Italy, the Middle East and Hong Kong. I'm now on Page 30, where you have our usual EBITDA bridge. We delivered a strong EBITDA growth of 5.7% like-for-like, fueled by the combination of the solid underlying revenue growth, strong efficiencies and synergies ahead of schedule. In detail, scope included the disposal of Sade from March 1 and the integration of bolt-on assets in Germany. ForEx negative impact reached minus €58 million, mainly in Latin America. Energy and recyclate impact was slightly negative, minus 1.8%, as we expected. EBITDA for Energy business was quite stable in Q1. Weather had an impact of minus 1.2% with the mild winter in Central Europe. EBITDA intrinsic growth was, therefore, fueled by the following effect: a more robust commerce and volume impact for plus 3.6%, continuous strong net efficiency and synergies for 5.1%. The synergy delivery continues to be ahead of target, reaching €42 million in Q1 and €357 million accumulated since the closing of the acquisition of Suez, which is remarkable. Moving to Slide 31. Let's see how the EBITDA increase is fueling the current EBIT, which is growing very strongly by 11.1% at €833 million. Renewable expense of €72 million are comparable with Q1 last year. Amortization, OFA and provision at €731 million is slightly down compared to 2023 with amortization slightly up due to the ramp-up of our contract in Uzbekistan and less impairment and provision than in 2023. JVs amounts to €22 million compared to €28 million last year, essentially due to a one-off in 2023. Our net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. CapEx remained quite stable and included €95 million of decarbonization CapEx with good progress on our Poznan project and €43 million of Hazardous Waste new projects, particularly in the U.S., in the Middle East and in Germany. The quarterly increase in net financial debt was due first to the seasonal reversal of working capital that was slightly higher than last year due to unfavorable calendar effects. It will not impact the free cash flow delivery of the year. We had higher payments in Q1 to water authorities in Water France and in CO2 products in Central Europe. And second, to the €200 million hybrid debt final repayment after the renewal of our €600 million hybrid debt in November last year. Our solid investment-grade rating has just been confirmed by S&P and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) with a stable outlook. Moving to Slide 33. To conclude, we, of course, confirm our ambitious guidance for 2024. Revenue, continued solid organic growth. For EBITDA, organic growth between 5% to 6%. More than €350 million of efficiency gains. More than €400 million cumulated synergies at the end of 2024. Current net income above €1.5 billion, which means a double-digit growth compared to 2023. Leverage ratio below 3x. And as usual, our dividend will grow in line with our current EPS. Thank you for your attention.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you, Claude. And now we are ready to take your questions.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arthur Sitbon from Morgan Stanley.

Arthur Sitbon: So the first one would be on the synergies and cost savings. I see that the synergies in Q1 are quite strong compared to what you expect for the full year. So I was wondering if we should expect a normalization there in the next 3 quarters or if it's just that potentially you're going to deliver strong synergies on the year. And on pretty much the same topic, on cost savings, the retention rate as well seems higher than usual, close to 45%. Was there anything unusual happening in Q1? Or is it what we can expect for the whole year? So that's the first question. The second one is that you talk -- while it's been several months now that you talk a lot about your booster activities and your stronghold activities. I was wondering if there is any action that you may consider to accelerate the shift of your business profile towards more booster activities and a bit less stronghold to potentially accelerate the overall group growth profile of Veolia.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Two very different questions, but in a way, they very much summarize 2 of the 3 levers of our value creation, be it growth and efficiency and delivery on that. So starting with synergies and cost savings. So yes, we've over-delivered in the first quarter. As usual, we will go on as fast as we can in delivering the synergies. Our commitment remains to deliver €500 million in 4 years. So at least €400 million by the end of this year. And we'll do it as quick as we can. And I guess in terms of behind figures what is there, there are quite different things throughout the various years. The first year was very much the HQ type of savings. Typically, I don't know, real estate has emerged and 2 HQs in the same city in one same building. Then we moved to, say, more operational things. Typically, I don't know, in Australia, rebooting of trucks. As you know, in Australia, we had like to 2 kind of similar in size activities in Waste, both in Suez and Veolia, which we've combined and so it's very operational. And I guess now we can see the benefits of the merger within the Water Tech zone, which was slightly delayed compared to, say, the Australia example and which I anticipate to go on for the next quarter. So no slowing down to anticipate in terms of the overall €500 million over 4 years, which we'll deliver as quick as we can. And I guess, as you know, I'm kind of repeating myself on that one. I like to deliver on our promise and this is my priority as time goes. And in those days of uncertainties in the world, I think to be able to stick to the plan is something which has some merit. In terms of cost savings, apart from synergies, who are traditional, shall I say, because it's become traditional to have cost savings, €300 million, which we've already enhanced from €200 million or €250 million, which was the initial type of figures to now €350 million per year. I'm very happy that on top of the traditional cost-savings plans we have throughout all the business units of Veolia throughout the world, we are adding specific ones depending on the specific situation. And typically, I've highlighted briefly in my introduction words the France-specific action plan. France hasn't been -- I mean has been all right, but not great last year. And that's why we've launched a specific action plan, which is starting to bear fruit. Same applies with what I mentioned on exiting some underperforming contracts like the one in Canada. So I guess, we're trying to be as agile as we can and we have been. And I guess, the next few years will be probably more of the same, plus, say, GenAI, typically, to fuel new ideas. And I tend to say kind of forever in Veolia, we always find new sources of efficiencies. In terms of your second question on growth, we've announced our strategic plan a few weeks ago. And I guess your question is very much aligned with the strategic direction I've highlighted a few weeks ago, which is booster and stronghold, both are important. In terms of stronghold, they account for roughly 70% of our revenue, the booster 30%. But in terms of investments, it will be the opposite way around and we expect the growth to come 70% from the boosters and only 30% from the stronghold. So I guess we put our money where our mouth is. And we already make a priority of those boosters, which doesn't mean that we forget the stronghold. And they are very important as well. Why is that so? They are kind of the foundations on which we anchor, we build the boosters. If I give one example, without our, I would say, classical historic activities of dry waste and municipal water, we wouldn't be able to deliver the bioenergy production from waste or from wastewater, just to give one example, which is a booster. So the two are really intertwined very much. And I guess when from the stronghold activities, the idea is to maintain our customer happy and to follow some growth. But say, it would be typically inflation plus 1%, what we expect from those type of activities. For the boosters, we're talking 5% to 10% or mid- to high single-digit growth, as we said. And I'm very happy that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter where our boosters have grown like exactly in this range and well above the average of the group in the first quarter. That's for the activities. And for the geographies, the same applies. We said we are very happy with our history and geography, so France and Europe typically. But we will have a higher rate of growth in the U.S., in the Middle East and Australia and that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter. Claude mentioned the Australian growth, the American one as well. And each of those 3 geographic boosters have grown by above 6%, and as we've seen in Water Tech, it's even 15%. So I guess, the priorities are translating into figures now and will be in the next few years. But I guess -- no, I was about to summarize in one more because my answer was very long. I guess it's resilience and growth, which we are aiming at delivering. Resilience comes from the strongholds. The growth comes from the boosters mainly, although you have a little bit of both in both activities, which means that when you say that a company like Veolia, which is long-term contracted activities, infrastructure-like in many ways, is able to deliver in the first quarter 3.9% in of revenue growth, I'm very happy about these results. And it's very, very much a testimony to your question about how to enhance growth. I think the figures demonstrate that.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Patel from Goldman Sachs.

Ajay Patel: Thank you very much for the presentation. I think my first sort of set of questions is on this teaser slide, on Slide 19, $200 billion estimated market. I don't think I, when I look at that, have the full appreciation of how Veolia's placed. I know that you have the range of technologies, but if you were to try to cater to that market, what will it take in regards to CapEx investment? What do you have already on the ground that can help to that solution? And what potentially could you invest to take advantage of this opportunity? Just helping me sort of translate the big sort of number that you presented to actually nuts and bolts, somewhat sort of lower down. And then I guess the second one is more granular, but just -- with an awful amount of wet weather, I just wondered potentially what could that mean in terms of the impact on water usage? Any sort of commentary around that would be helpful.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Sorry, I haven't understood your second question well enough.

Claude Laruelle: Total usage.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Water usage. Okay, sorry, due to PFAS, you mean, or is it a totally separate question?

Ajay Patel: Sorry, separate question. The second one is separate, but just the first one, give us more on this PFAS. Does it sound like a massive opportunity? It's just it doesn't feel -- it doesn't -- I can't really frame it in my mind in regards to Veolia, yes.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Okay. Good. So two different questions on PFAS, which is the Page 19 you were referring to. I guess a few things on that one. This is about anticipation, positioning, patents and technologies and let me explain why. PFAS, as you know, is quite an emerging market. That's why the numbers I've mentioned are publicized by third parties. As you know, they are our first estimate. But as I said, the legislation in the U.S. dates back from 3 weeks ago or something like that and it's still evolving and in Europe it's the same. So it's difficult to assess with and to answer very, very precisely to your question. But there is a unique potential market, which we know will be very, very sizable. What we know as well is it's going to take a little bit of time because legislation translates into projects and then into delivery and then into margin for Veolia. So a little bit of it will see in this GreenUp plan and probably much more in the one after, given some of the time to deliver on those. But the new opportunity is huge and we are uniquely positioned, that's for certain. How is that so? I detailed that in our deep dive in the U.S. a few weeks ago. So if you want to know more, I encourage you to watch the replay. But in a nutshell, PFAS, say, you can find it in many places in water as well as in soil and sites that you have to decontaminate. So typically, if you see a map of the world, a map of the U.S. we've shown, a map of Europe, you see PFAS pretty much everywhere where you have large industrial chemical parks as well as every single airport and airbase, basically. And you can see a map where you have PFAS. How do you treat those? You have usually to concentrate and this is with membranes or resins. It happens that we are #1 in those technologies with Water Tech business. Then you have to, say, treat as in -- I was about to say destroy and cut into pieces. And this is with our high-temperature incinerator, which typically can do that. High-temperature incinerator, meaning 150 degrees Celsius, just to give you an idea what I mean by high temperature, which our Hazardous Waste business. So in a way, this is an example where we have the municipal water activity, the Water Technologies like in resins and membranes as well as the Hazardous Waste business, and we are the leaders in every single of those three businesses, actually #1 in each of the three actually in the world and in the various geographies I've just mentioned. So in a way, we have competitors, of course, in each of those segments. I really believe in each of those segments we are the best. But what's very unique is our ability to offer the full range, the end-to-end solution. And I cannot see anyone offering the end-to-end solution. And why is it so important? It means that for customers, you would need resin, in another one you would need membrane, for the third one you have go directly to a high-temperature incinerator or whatever because every single situation is different if you talk about an airport pollution, if you talk about a refinery or if you talk about water. So this is really an example of an ecology of solutions, which is, Mr. Customer, you have a problem. We manage to design a solution to fit your needs and we have the full portfolio from end-to-end again. So difficult to assess how speed -- how quick, I guess, this market will translate into our figures because, again, the legislation is very, very recent. But given what I said, we know which we have a unique opportunity here to offer what we do very well and what we're the leader of. We already have some contracts we signed because some customers have anticipated the legislation in a way. So it's typically the Department of Defense in Australia or some specific customers in the U.S. and it even started in Europe, so we have already had a few contracts. They are not significant in numbers as in we're talking millions of euros or dozens of millions, no more, so far. But it's moving super, super quick. On the second question, which is the water usage. If your question is about billing between weather and water usage, I would like to try and understand better your question to be able to answer more precisely if you can. Was that restriction of water -- water restriction you mean or water quality? Or tell me.

Ajay Patel: I was just thinking the weather seems to have been quite wet. And to what extent could that impact your Waste volumes in the second half of the year or over the remaining quarters so that it could be a benefit to you?

Estelle Brachlianoff: I guess the Waste volume, you probably mean the Water volume?

Ajay Patel: Water volume. I'm sorry.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Yes, yes. Just -- Okay. So you always have a little bit of weather impact in Veolia. That's why we have shown you on the various bridge that Claude has what we call the interesting growth, which is the self-help, if you want, from growing our activities and efficiency. And we've had a negative weather effect in the winter, so we may have a positive or negative weather in the summer. I can tell you that whatever is the summer like, I commit on delivering on the guidance I repeated. So that's the usual one. Second -- so that's the short-term answer. So we can confirm the guidance, whatever. The second answer is on the, I guess, midterm trends. It's fair to say that the summary of '22 in France, the summer of '23 in the U.K. and I could go on like that and in Spain and so on and so forth means that it was such a shocker for municipalities and populations and industries alike that even when it rains, the push for solutions, be the reduction of [indiscernible] or reuse of wastewater and all the rest of it is still very much top of the list of our customers. So it's good news that it has rained, so the underground water are now a bit more full than they were a few weeks ago. But I can tell you, our customers are still very, very, very adamant to find solution because everybody has perfectly understood that this type of event is here to stay and even to reinforce because it's the first consequence of global warming, basically. A testimony to that is the survey we've conducted with Elabe in 24 countries with 26,000 people in the world, which we've just released the results a few weeks ago, where the population -- everyone in the world basically has understood that we need solution as in now. And I can tell you whatever the weather is like, this is here to stay. So we are on a megatrend, which I'm very confident is here to stay because it's pushed the demand from the population itself.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Olly Jeffery from Deutsche Bank.

Olly Jeffery: So a couple of questions. First one, I'd just like to think about how you're seeing the rest of the year in terms of the outlook for Waste growth in China and Europe, given the economic picture is looking slightly better for those regions. So are you seeing any evidence of that yet because I know that in China, obviously, it's been slightly depressed for your business there. And the other question I have was around just the specifics within the DNA. So industrial capital gains and net provisions are up €31 million versus €10 million last year. Can you just explain what's driving that, please? And my last question is for the full year is €100 million FX headwind at the EBITDA level still the right order of magnitude? Or have things improved a little bit with the movement in the Chilean peso recently?

Estelle Brachlianoff: Sorry, I don't think I heard well the third question. Okay. EBITDA to EBIT, okay, sorry.

Claude Laruelle: On the first one, the rest of the year. So we see no change in the Waste activities. So the Waste activities, as you can see, has been well performing in the start of the year, plus 5.5% in terms of revenue. And in April, we have the same -- and the start of the May, we have the same trend as in Q1. So we are starting the year very well on the Waste activity. And so far, so good. The current trending is the same as we speak, as what we have seen in Q1. And for China, this is one of your question. We had -- the China solid waste was better than the start of the year, especially on plastic recycling. So we had a slightly better momentum in China. In terms of quality of earnings, if this is your question, and the EBITDA to EBIT transmission. As I said in Q1, we have slightly more amortization than last year with the ramp-up of the Tashkent contract, so a little bit more depreciation and amortization. On the provision side, the main topic was a provision that we had to take last year to cover the risk for a contract ending for around €20 million, and we had no such risk to cover in Q1 2024, which is good news. And on the other side, for the JVs, we had a positive one-off in 2023 and no such thing in 2024. So if you look at EBITDA, EBITDA has increased by €50 million. And it translates directly into EBIT level at €55 million, so the same amount if you compare to the EBITDA evolution and the EBIT evolution.

Estelle Brachlianoff: And just to complement Claude's answer on the first question. As we've said, we are 85%, we think something like that, immune to macro, which means that, in a way, I would differentiate a little bit Veolia's result from the GDP results and how the economy is going to countries you mentioned. In a way, I can comment on China GDP, but I'd rather comment on Veolia growth in Europe or in China, which were your two questions. And again, we are -- we have some very limited impact of the GDP, say, the 15%. But more interestingly, there is a part of it which is more commerce. And it's fair to say in some geographies, it's difficult for us to distinguish. Say, the Waste volume is a little bit up in the first quarter as you've seen by 1-point-something percent, 1.2%. And part of it is probably the economy doing a little bit better, and part of it is us being better than the competition. How do I split both? You know what? It's very difficult to say. And we've seen in some geographies, our competitors complaining and us being relatively happy because our job is to try, and again, like win valuable business and not only just to follow what the economy tells us. China being a good example, we've put a specific action plan in place. So we are not waiting for the rebound of the industry in China. We've put some action plan in place. So EBITDA is on the up, although revenue is not. I mean, it's kind of flat minus, something like that. But we have the EBITDA on the up because again I would distinguish the macro picture and whether Veolia delivers from it.

Olly Jeffery: That's clear. And just following up on the last question on the FX impact. I think before, you've spoken about €100 million for the full year at the EBITDA level. Is that still the right level to think about? And what should we think about the net income line because obviously a lot of that comes out through minorities. It might be helpful just to clarify on that bit, too.

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So for ForEx impact, we said between €70 million and €80 million if the currency stays at the same level, Olly. And the impact that net income will be super small. So whatever the ForEx, we can fully confirm that the net income will be above €1.5 billion at year-end.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jenny Ping from Citi.

Jenny Ping: I've got two questions, please. Just firstly, just going back to the PFAS point, can I ask what is the EPA regulation in terms of the removal rate because my understanding is that it's quite difficult for total removal of any PFAS substances in the water. And then secondly, linked to that, if I can also ask whether you guys have your own proprietary technology, i.e., competitive edge for the removal process, that would be great. And then just alongside of that, if I can ask for a bit more color around the recyclate prices and commodities movements that you've seen recently. Normally, you have the chart in the back of your pack, which shows the movements in commodity prices and recyclates, but I don't think it's there. So if you can give some commentary around that would be great.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you. So on PFAS, I would -- again, sorry, I encourage you to have a look at our replay on the U.S. deep dive, which will explain the whole detail of the EPA legislation, which had been released a few days before we've done this deep dive. I won't go into very much detail. We had two different sets of legislation so far, I mean, if I call EPA legislation, it's more standard than legislation, as such. The first one was on potable water and the second one was more on polluted soil and such, if you want, called [indiscernible]. And in both cases, you're right, it's very difficult to talk about total renewable. So there is a list of specific PFAS because, as you know, PFAS is a family of products, some of them being very likely [indiscernible] some of them very, very likely not. And it's not for me to decide. It's the sanitary and health authorities which decide that. And It has translated into a specific list of a few PFAS, where the combined pollution level, if you want, has to be detected below a certain threshold. And I guess, so just to give you a metaphor. The threshold is very small, but it's not 0 because, as you said, the total renewable is difficult. But it's so small, it's the equivalent of the size of a sugar cube in the middle of an Olympic swimming pool, just to give you the idea of the type of threshold the legislation has said will be -- have to be implemented in the next 5 years. Do we have our own technology? Yes, we do and they are patented. Again, resin, patented; membrane, patented; and very unique as well set of technologies in the high-temperature incinerator, which are above 1,100 degrees, as I mentioned. So yes, it's patented technologies and quite unique. And as you know, in those three, we are #1 player in the world, #1 player in Water Tech in the U.S. As well and #2 in the Hazardous Waste, so just to mention the U.S. And same applies with Europe, we are #1 in Water Tech and #1 in Hazardous Waste in Europe just the same. So yes, we have our own technologies to treat those. But as I mentioned earlier on, it's not only our technology, it's a set of technologies and the broadness of the end-to-end solution, combining the Water Tech, the Hazardous Waste, which makes us very unique. In terms of recyclate price and commodities, Claude, do you want to comment?

Claude Laruelle: So recyclate, the main topic for us is the paper and cardboard. What we are seeing in the -- you know it has dropped a lot, as I said, in the second part of 2022. After, we have seen a low price since -- during the course of 2023. We have seen a slightly up movement in Q1, especially in the month of March, which is really encouraging for the rest of the year. So we see a movement up in recyclates as we speak.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So it's -- but it's a limited one. So I guess our job is to deliver the result irrespective of the commodities price in a way, be it recyclates or be it energy, as I mentioned in my introduction speech. And the plastic price is, I guess, average low. So I guess do we have a potential for improvement in the next few years? Yes, we do. The price released still relatively low as we speak. When is it going to happen? I won't make any bet on that because it's always difficult to predict any commodities, but our commitment is on delivering on our guidance.

Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Alexandre Roncier from Bank of America.

Alexandre Roncier: I've got two, please. The first one is just a follow-up on the EBITDA to EBIT bridge. I think in your press release, you mentioned capital gains. So that was just to confirm the size of them, and if anything material was coming out of Sade for the quarter? And then the second one is I was looking at your free cash flow, and obviously, there's some phasing quarter-over-quarter and within the year. But I think you mentioned in your press release again some disbursement from carbon. And I was just wondering really the movements there, given that carbon prices are quite much lower year-over-year. And I would have expected perhaps lower by given the mild winter in your district heating business. So maybe if you can talk about the different driving forces there or if you were maybe a bit more tactical as other industrial players have been, I think, within the market for carbon buying.

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So on the capital gain that was very minimal because, as you know, on the EBIT level we record only the industrial capital gains, so that was only a few millions. So nothing relevant in terms of capital gains for the EBITDA to EBIT translation. In terms of free cash flow, in terms of -- and Sade capital gain will be below EBIT and will be released during the H1 results, but it's a positive one, I can confirm. In terms of free cash flow and the CO2. So it's a matter of calendar. So as I said, it's just a calendar effect. In CO2, as you know, we have a hedging policy, the same hedging policy in terms of CO2 as what we have on energy. Because we don't want to take market risk, so we hedge when we sell the energy in the market, we hedge the CO2 in the meantime. So we have a CO2 price, which is slightly above the market today, but we are buying CO2 on the market for the years to come and that will be also good news for our Energy business in 2025 and in 2026. And in terms of payments, it's just, as I said, the calendar effect Q1 versus the end of the year. So no impact on the delivery of free cash flow regarding this calendar effect.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Rodriguez from Kepler.

Juan Rodriguez: I have two in my side, if I may. The first one is, again, coming back on working capital and this seasonal, but increasing effect. I just want to confirm that you're expecting the end of the year towards normalization and relatively flat? And the second on this working cap is on the higher CO2 quotas. I want to confirm that it does not include U.K. as there was kind -- has been a recent article signaling a possible cost increase on incinerators in the country. So this is the first one -- kind of 1.2 question. And the second one is on acquisition. So if you can give us more color on the acquisition price and valuation of Hofmann in Germany and any color as well on the price evaluation of the Uniper CGT assets in Hungary will be helpful.

Claude Laruelle: So I'll start with the working capital. So no topic about the U.K. So it's not a topic at all on the working capital. And in terms of -- yes, we will reverse the working capital at year-end as usual, Juan. It's -- and we know that we start always with Q1 with a stronger negative working capital and it's always reversed progressively in Q3 and Q4. So no change regarding working capital for Veolia. Estelle...

Estelle Brachlianoff: Yes. On the others, so as you know, the U.K. CO2 for incineration, which was your second question, we're talking 2028, if, so going into the ETS scheme. So nothing to do with neither this year nor the years of the GreenUp plan. But in anticipation, in a way, we knew it were likely to come. Hence, we've started a few projects to capture CO2 from our incinerator, which is a very specific CO2, as I explained in London, actually following a question I had on that one because it's biogenic CO2, which is in a way that kind of, let's call it, the good CO2 as opposed to the bad CO2, which is a non-biogenic one. So no impact at all to expect. And by the way, the various costs will be bear-ed eventually by the municipalities in the end, not by Veolia. But we want to help, and therefore, we've launched a few projects. And you can see a press release in the U.K. about CO2 capture and storage and so on and so forth. In terms of the Uniper and off-line prices, there is a reason why we don't publish the price. And usually, it's because the sellers don't want us to. And I guess you can see that it's usually good news when the sellers doesn't want to publish the price of an acquisition made by Veolia. For us, I mean, good news for us. I guess, I will stay there, but highly value creative. So I think it's a very good example of, what I call, the third pillar of our value creation, which is, I guess, the optimization of the balance sheet and the portfolio of activities while constantly reviewing the plus and the minuses. And on those two, which are on the acquisition side, quick value creation because it's synergistic in both cases with our existing activities, in one case in Germany recycling; and the other one, flexibility in Hungary, which we do already have activities in Hungary in the same type of things. So value creation, relatively quick. I would say, a little bit plug and play, if you allow me the metaphor. So quite good illustration of that. So it's going to be value creation relatively quickly.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Palliez from CIBC Market Solutions -- sorry, CIC Market Solutions.

Arnaud Palliez: I have just one remaining follow-up question on the changes in scope. Can you give us the impact on full year revenue and margin for the acquisitions of Uniper and Hofmann -- or the deal with Uniper. And a reminder also about Morocco, Lydec, what can be the impact on annual sales and margin? And the same question on the disposal side regarding the Italian water concessions.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So you made a quite a long list on the plus side, Uniper and Hofmann. On the minus side, Italia and maybe the Lydec one. So if I summarize all that is included in our guidance for the year, obviously. And whatever the date I'm going to briefly detail, I guess it won't change our €1.5 billion net result target, I would say, in absolute value irrespective of the scope for the end of the year. I think that's the important bit. So you have the plus and the minuses compensated. And altogether, of course, we expect all that to create value and be a plus. Uniper is not closed yet. We're talking about later in the year, probably the autumn, something like that. Hofmann, it will be in the account, I think, it varies, a little bit in Q1 and there will be the rest in Q2 onwards. Lydec, I guess, no impact on net results because it's very, very, I guess, limiting in terms of net results contribution. And in terms of Sade, in a way, it has a large impact on revenue, but not on margins because, as I said, we're talking about an EBITDA percentage of roughly around 5%. So it's a good business. And the reason why we've sold it is not the 5%, it's a good performance for a construction type of business. But we're not keen to keep construction businesses, as we've highlighted a few times. And Italia, it was not consolidated because it was a series of minority shares where we didn't have an operational impact on and that's exactly why we sold. So it's a very different situation and very small.

Claude Laruelle: Very small EBIT impact, nonsignificant. Absolutely nonsignificant at group level. So very happy.

Estelle Brachlianoff: That's why all that -- so yes, so all that will again contribute to the €1.5 billion target at current.

Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Philippe Ourpatian from ODDO BHF.

Philippe Ourpatian: Yes. I have two follow-up questions. The first one is concerning ForEx. You confirmed a €70 million, €80 million impact. But just could we have, as it's very difficult and mainly linked to Argentina where the situation is a little bit troubled view from Europe, could you just have a kind of sensitivity about what's going to happen if, let's say, your forecast in terms of Argentinian pesos is not exactly aligned with the figure at the end of the year as you are accounting through inflationary-trained accounting principle. It means that you are taking, let's say, the last day of the quarter or the full year. And just to have a kind of sensitivity concerning the main LatAm ForEx impact at the EBITDA level, please? That's the first one. And the second one is in the Slide 30, you mentioned some good retention rate. When I'm taking the €33 million net efficiencies, let's say, and the €88 million on the gross value, it seems that we are always around the 50%. Is this means that we are starting to have a better retention rate in terms of efficiency versus the past? Or is it something specific to Q1?

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So maybe on the first one, the best guess that we can make, Philippe, is to take the actual assumption with the actual exchange rate and have a projection on the full year. Argentinian business is very small and EBITDA is very small, so it will not have additional significant impact when you have the full year with the hyperinflation in December resetting the entire year of ForEx impact. So because it's small, we don't expect this to be at the end of the year material in terms of ForEx impact in Argentina. That's what we see today.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So on the retention rate, which is your second question, it made me realize that I didn't answer on that question already asked a few minutes ago. Yes, you're right, 38 divided by 88 is now 43% than 50%. But nevertheless, it's on the upper part of our range, which we said is always between 30% and 50% depending on the quarters. So does it mean that we'll stay at this type of range as in 43%? You know, 30% to 50% is traditional for us, so I guess the middle part of the range is a good assumption for me going forward. And the specificity of Q1 was more what I mentioned on the Water Tech, which was really, I guess, volume-based and growth-based rather than, I guess, SG&A, which at times necessitates a bit of cost to be able to extract efficiencies. So I guess the retention rate depends more on the type of efficiency than anything else. When you're talking SG&A at times, you have a bit to pay to get them extracted. Therefore, the net is a little bit on the lower range. When you talk about, say, purchasing, it's more on the upper end of the range. And the mix makes it different from quarter to the other. And the upper part of the range is due, again, mainly on the Water Tech efficiency plan in the first quarter.

Philippe Ourpatian: Yet in fact, my question was also linked to the GreenUp strategy. It means that are you forecasting to have a better, maybe, retention rate due to this, let's say, new strategy more -- mainly focused on having additional value, making more complex, let's say, technical contract and so on? That's also part of my question.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So I guess, the way to see the GreenUp objective is €300 million per year plus the second part of the synergies, of course, plus the top line growth, all that fueling EBITDA. So in a way, what is important for me is really the 6% average basically growth of EBITDA, which we've published which is 8% -- sorry, €8 billion EBITDA target for 2027. I guess this is more the figure because you have pluses and minuses. Of course, if we can retain more in efficiency plan, we will. But we can have weather impact as well as we've seen in this quarter or not great commodities, so I guess you have pluses and minuses. That's why the way to see it is really the target of EBITDA and the target even more so in net results, which is 10% on average over the duration of the plan. I guess that's what the attention is focused on. And usually at Veolia, when we have a specific things happening, we react with an extra specific plan as we've done particularly in France, which is starting to bear fruit. So I guess, instead of talking about average of retention, I'd rather [indiscernible] on, again, net results over the duration of the plan, which is what we are focusing our attention upon with EPS in line in terms of growth.

Operator: Thank you. There seems to be no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brachlianoff for final closing comments.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you very much for attending this conference call. And again, very good result, which helps me to see 2024 with great confidence and confirm our objective for the year and a very good start of our GreenUp plan. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Claude Laruelle - Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Veolia Q1 2024 Key Figures Conference Call with Estelle Brachlianoff, CEO; and Claude Laruelle, CFO. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded May 14, 2024.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Estelle Brachlianoff. Please go ahead.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this conference call to present Veolia's results for the first quarter of '24. And with me is Claude Laruelle, our Chief Financial Officer.

Our first quarter results are, once again, excellent. They are perfectly in line with our annual objective and enable us to start 2024 with great confidence and fully confirm our guidance for the year.

And I'm on Slide 4 where you would see sales came to €11.5 billion, up 3.9%, excluding energy price, which are essentially pass-through for us, as you know.

EBITDA has increased by substantial 5.7% on a like-for-like basis to €1.624 billion and current EBIT by 11.1% to €843 million. Net financial debt is well under control and in line with our target of leverage ratio below 3x at year-end. These results are the fruit of our unique positioning as the world's leader of environmental services, which, combined with the sustained effort and professional efficiency enables us to deliver both resilience and growth of our results. The last few months have confirmed the choices of our next strategic program, GreenUp, which, for instance, the critical importance for both cities and industries of deploying solutions to tackle water scarcity and onshore water quality, those challenges where Veolia has a leadership position, as you know.

I'm on Slide 5. And you can see we registered very solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy price, fueled in particular by Water and Waste, which grew by 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively.

Regarding Energy, as anticipated, lower energy price has weighted on our top line, but our Energy revenue has been flat, excluding the effect of energy price and has even grown by 1% if you exclude negative weather effect in the first quarter.

As you know, our Energy margin as in EBITDA is well protected from the ups and downs of energy price, which showed again in the first quarter. Actually, we expect 2024 Energy EBITDA to remain at the high level we reached last year despite lower energy price.

How is that so? Veolia is quite unique in the energy market since we operate in local energy only as we explained last January during our deep dive dedicated to energy.

As I've said, we anticipated this, which is the reason why we have published our revenue growth, excluding energy price, each quarter since 2022 as they do not impact our performance. Energy is a profitable and growing activity for Veolia.

Slide 6. In order to detail how we've delivered another quarter of very good results, I would like to start by briefly explaining Veolia's recipe for value creation, which lies in 3 key engines: top line growth, efficiency and capital allocation.

Starting with revenue growth. We combined stronghold activities, which were very resilient essential services, infrastructure-like with three growth boosters, namely, water technologies and new solutions, hazardous waste treatment and bioenergies, flexibility and energy efficiency. Our stronghold activities enjoy security and high contract renewal rates.

Anchored in those, our booster activities grew at mid- to high single-digit rates as they are driven by strong market trends and Veolia's unique positioning, water quality and scarcity, regulation to protect health and reshoring, just to mention a few.

The second pillar of value creation is our strict management of operations and attention to delivery. Each year, we deliver €350 million of efficiency gains, which have been topped up by cost synergies of the Suez merger, an addition of €500 million over 5 years -- 4 years, sorry.

The third pillar is our capital allocation. We target high value-creating projects or tuck-in acquisitions in line with our strategic priorities. So typically our 3 growth boosters, all the geographies in which we want to expand. Our internal rule is IRR above WACC plus 4% and ROCE above WACC after year 3 for these investments.

Meanwhile, we constantly review our portfolio of assets to check if there is still some value creation ahead. If not or when the asset is not in line with our strategy, typically construction or FM activities or subscale presence, we may decide to sell.

This value creation model is the backbone of our GreenUp plan with current net income growth of 10% per annum on average and the dividend growing in line with EPS and ROCE post-tax above 9% in 2027.

I'm on Slide 8, and let me detail now each of those 3 pillars of value creation and the way they have translated into Q1 results, starting with top line growth. In Q1, we delivered solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, thanks to continued strong foundation with regards to indexation, pricing, contract renewal and new wins.

In addition to a particularly strong performance in the Water Tech booster, both in delivery and new order book, up 50% in Q1 to €1.8 billion.

In terms of geographies, Australia, the Middle East and the U.S., which you know are our growth boosters, performed particularly well, each of them above 6% growth, which is aligned with our ambition laid in our GreenUp plan.

On Page 9, you have a focus on the performance of activities defined as stronghold in our GreenUp plan, which performed very well in Q1. Water municipal operations and Solid Waste revenue progressed very well, thanks to commercial momentum, better volumes, [indiscernible] indexation and continued pricing power. So 30% of our contracts, which are not indexed.

District heating networks were flat, excluding energy price, due to mild weather in Central and Eastern Europe, but will have progressed otherwise. All registered strong commercial wins, notably the renewal of the SEDIF contract, which I'm very pleased with, as you would expect.

As you know, and I'm now on Page 10, this contract provides water services for 4 million inhabitants in 132 municipalities around Paris for a total revenue of €4 billion over 12 years. We managed to renew this contract, thanks in particular to a series of very innovative solutions, which will make this contract a worldwide reference of water services of the 21st century with 10 world-firsts. These include the combination of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to treat all new pollutants from PFAS to pesticide residues or endocrine disruptors as well to AI to help improve network efficiency to 93%, just to mention a few. As you can see, innovation is really at the heart of what we do at Veolia.

On Page 11, now we'll focus on the performance of our GreenUp booster activities in Q1. Water Technologies continued to perform excessively well in terms of sales, earnings and bookings. Revenue grew by 15% in all our lines of business within Water Tech, while booking increased by 50% to €1.8 billion, including another big success in desalination in Dubai at Hassyan.

In local decarbonizing energy, we continue to grow in flexibility with a 430-megawatt assets acquired from Uniper in Hungary, which will complement our own asset -- set of assets in this country. As you know, with this promising and strategic market, which is critical to the grid given the development of renewables, and with this operation, Veolia now has 2.4 gigawatts of managed flexible electrical energy in Europe.

Still in local decarbonizing energy. In France, we are installing a series of solar panels on our landfills, which will produce 300 megawatts of green electricity by 2027.

On Slide 12, you can see a list of some of the bookings in Water Tech we have recorded in Q1 with several contracts in semiconductors or oil and gas. On the Hassyan desalination project, I'm very proud that we'll have, with this one, the most energy-efficient worldwide desalination in the world and not a small one because it will serve 2 million inhabitants.

And actually, when I said energy-efficient, we have crossed the floor of 3-kilowatt hour per cubic meter of water produced, which seemed unreachable only 10 years ago and which is a 35% reduction compared to 10 years ago and even 5x lower than the project we designed 30 years ago. You can see with this example that Veolia innovation helps save energy, money and CO2.

On Slide 14, now let's deep dive into our second lever of value creation, which is performance and efficiency. You can see on this slide our first quarter performance in terms of operating efficiency and synergies. In terms of efficiency, we achieved €88 million in gains, in line with our annual target of €350 million.

I'm pleased to see the specific action plan launched in France late last year bear its first fruits in Q1. In addition, we have fixed or exited a few underperforming contracts, notably one in Canada.

In terms of cost synergies derived from the Suez merger, we are ahead of schedule and have achieved €42 million in Q1, or cumulative of €357 million since the start of the merger with Suez.

Safe to say that the efficiency program are now part of the DNA and will remain so, leveraging on our more than 3,000 plants and units worldwide. But we are constantly looking for new tools and new opportunities, such as GenAI now, which we have dozen tests underway as we speak.

The last driver of our value creation is capital allocation where we were particularly active in Q1, and I'm on Slide 16. Our CapEx program continued at a sustained pace with ongoing projects to build new hazardous waste treatment facilities in the U.S., Germany and Saudi.

All those projects will be commissioned in 2025 and will fuel growth and increase return in this activity, which is among the 3 boosters of our GreenUp plan. As you know, Hazardous Waste already accounts for 10% of group sales and we are the world leader present on all continents.

In parallel, we continued the conversion plan of our coal-fired facilities with €95 million invested during the first quarter in Poland and the Czech Republic. We expect a double-digit return from our decarbonization CapEx and are already benefiting from the higher profitability of our new Braunschweig facility, which was converted last year.

We have been quite active in terms of bolt-on acquisition as well from Uniper flexibility assets in Hungary to recycling activities in Germany. Those two tuck-ins are a perfect illustration of our business model as they complement our existing asset footprint perfectly and generate significant synergies from day 1.

And on February 29, we completed the disposal of Sade, as this construction activity, mainly in France, was noncore and with an EBITDA margin of around 5% dilutive for the rest of the group.

These very good results in Q1 confirms the strength of our business model, which we summarize on Slide 18. Veolia is very resilient as we provide social services, both to municipal and industrial clients, with full asset ownership and more than 90% of renewal contracts.

85% of sales are not exposed to the economic cycle. We are protected against inflation, thanks to contract indexation formulas and our pricing power as we've proven and sustained in the last 3 years.

We enjoy leadership position in all our key countries, which has proven key to pricing power, in particular.

We benefit from balanced geographical footprint with 40% outside Europe, of which more than $5 billion in the U.S., no country outside the U.S. with more than 10% of the group's capital employed.

Of course, in addition to these strengths, Veolia enjoys growth thanks to supportive megatrends and the unique positioning as the world leader of environmental services. Water quality, water scarcity, socioeconomic challenges, hazardous waste treatment, decarbonization are here to stay and we are the key to enabling our customers to grow sustainably.

To illustrate our unique positioning, I'm now on Slide 19, let me give this example of PFAS, which is the case in point. Thanks to our innovation and the set of patented technologies we've developed, which includes membranes and resins as well as high-temperature incineration, we are now ready to treat these emerging pollutants.

The combination of our various businesses in Water Technologies, Water operations as well as Hazardous Waste enable us to offer an end-to-end solution. Our presence in the U.S. when those pollutants were first detected has helped us to anticipate and be ready to treat this pollutant in Europe now.

And actually things are moving fast in PFAS. In the first quarter alone, we've seen in the U.S. two new regulations from the EPA, which represents an estimated market for remediation and solutions estimated to $250 billion in the U.S. alone. Veolia has already started to treat PFAS [indiscernible] with water in [indiscernible] water in France, in the U.S. and in Australia.

So I'm now on Slide 20. Veolia is a unique global leader in environmental services, ideally positioned to address fast-growing demand trends across the globe from water scarcity to decarbonization and decontamination to protection and health as the case of PFAS strategy illustrates. Our international presence in 44 countries and in the top 3 niche of our key countries is a key success factor as much as our strongly engaged workforce.

On Slide 21, the very strong Q1 results allow me to fully confirm our target for 2024 and are very much in line with our GreenUp objectives. The financial and nonfinancial objective of our strategic plan are summarized in this slide. They include current net income growth of an average of 10% per year with dividends growing in line with EPS.

I now hand over to Claude who will detail the Q1 '24 results before we both dive to your questions. Claude?

Claude Laruelle

Thank you, Estelle, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm on Slide 23. And as Estelle already highlighted, our Q1 2024 results are, once again, remarkable and allow us to be very confident for the rest of the year. With €11.5 billion revenue, we experienced a good organic revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, driven by good commercial momentum and improved Water and Waste volumes, continued favorable indexation on our long-term contracts and price increases on nonindexed businesses.

Taking into account the impact of lower energy prices, revenue was down by 1.7%, as expected, without impact on EBITDA.

Thanks to the operating leverage and the good delivery of synergies, we enjoyed a solid organic EBITDA growth of 5.7% at €1.624 billion and a current EBIT growth of 11.1% at €843 million. Net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. You can also see on the slide the detailed ForEx impact, which were negative in Q1, minus €228 million at revenue level and minus €58 million at EBITDA level.

Assuming the exchange rates remain at today's level, the full year impact at EBITDA level would be between €70 million and €80 million. As a reminder, as we operate in local currency, ForEx impacts are only translation and not transaction impacts.

On Slide 24, you have our usual revenue bridge detailing the different effects and showing our top line intrinsic growth of 4.5% composed of commercial wins and pricing, those two green boxes on the right-hand side of the bridge.

Looking at the full bridge in more details, what do we see? First, ForEx had a negative impact of minus 1.9%, mostly in Latin America. Second, scope impact is limited, minus 0.1%, after Sade disposal in February and a few tuck-ins. As a reminder, Sade is a construction business with low margin.

For organic growth, we continued to enjoy solid growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, which is fueled by good commercial momentum, volume growth, strong growth activities, price and indexation increase in Water and Waste. The main item on the bridge is, of course, the lower energy prices for €679 million, with almost no impact on EBITDA. Recyclate prices have stabilized and the impact is insignificant in Q1 at revenue and EBITDA levels. The weather impact was unfavorable, minus 0.4%, compared to 2023, which was already mild. We experienced, in fact, the warmest winter over the last 30 years in Central Europe.

Moving to Slide 25. You can see the revenue evolution by geographical segment and I start with Water Technologies, which delivered another very strong quarter, both in terms of revenue and bookings. Revenue are up 15% with sustained growth in all our business lines. And in terms of bookings, as Estelle said, we registered a record level of bookings of €1.8 billion, including more than €600 million in the U.S.

In the Rest of the World, all regions performed very well. Notably, Australia had a very strong growth of 8.5%, thanks to good Waste performance, several contract wins, strict pricing discipline and good landfill volumes.

Latin America grew double digits, thanks to good Waste volumes and pricing. Underlying activity was well oriented in Brazil, Chile and Colombia with several new contracts. To take a few, Las Salinas in Chile for soil remediation or Braskem biomass in Brazil. Africa/Middle East revenue was up 4%, thanks to strong business in Morocco and new energy efficiency contracts in the Middle East in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi.

North America continued to enjoy solid Hazardous Waste performance and good Water activity. In Hazardous waste, for example, we benefited from a favorable mix effect and average prices are up 7%.

In Asia, solid growth in Hong Kong, plus 10%, with a very strong performance of our Waste activity and our Energy efficiency business. And in Japan, it was up 4.7% with strong performance of Water operations.

Rest of Europe revenue was up 1%, excluding energy prices. In Central Europe, the impact of lower energy prices in district heating activity was partially offset by the very good Water activity. In Northern Europe, we registered an outstanding U.K. performance, good indexation and strong PFI activity with a weaker availability of 98%. Southern Europe enjoyed strong commercial and Water activity and improved tariff indexation.

Finally, France and Hazardous Waste Europe. After a difficult 2023, we're turning the tide. Revenue grew by 2.7%, an improvement after only 1.4% in 2023, thanks to good performance in Water and Waste. We also initiated profitability enhancement actions in France with a strong commercial focus and very specific efficiency targets with quick returns. As a result, France EBITDA is up 5% in Q1.

I'm on Slide 26. And you can see the main trend by activity that I will detail in the next slide. Water and Waste enjoyed a very good work in Q1 as we expected and are fueling the revenue and the EBITDA growth of the group.

And we review our activities one by one and I'll start with Water on Slide 27, our largest activity, representing 40% of our revenue. Water business grew by 6.5%, driven actually by volume/commerce, plus 3%; and pricing, plus 3.6% thanks to, first, good volumes especially in Central Europe, plus 4.2%; Morocco, plus 2.4%; and France, plus 0.5%; continued favorable tariff indexation in France, for example, plus 4.5%; and in Central Europe, high-single digits in average. The quarter was, of course, marked by the signing of the new SEDIF contract for 12 years, which Estelle already detailed.

In regulated water, in particular, in the U.S., volumes were up 3% and we concluded several favorable rate case negotiations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. And in Chile, for Aguas Sandinas, volumes were stable and we have continued favorable price indexation.

Q1 was also marked by an outstanding Water Technology performance, in particular, the membrane business with increased sales of our AERO Products, the project business with the beginning of the Samsung contract and the St. Louis sludge project, both in the U.S., and the chemical products with strong volumes and price increases.

The commercial activity remained very strong, and we have a very large pipeline of projects ahead of us. As Estelle highlighted, we have just booked a very large desalination project in Dubai for $320 million that will continue to fuel the growth of Water Tech.

I'm moving to Slide 28 on Waste. Waste activities grew at a faster pace than in previous quarter by 5.5% compared to 3.4% in 2023, thanks to continued pricing power, improved volumes in Europe and good commercial momentum in Australia and Latin America.

To take a few examples. In Europe, the U.K. had a very good start to the year with very strong PFI and also C&I performance. In Germany, we had a strong commercial activity and we stabilized the volumes. France was better than last year in terms of volumes and also in terms of profitability.

We managed our electricity from our sales well, thanks to our hedging policy with selling prices higher than last year.

In Australia, the activity remained well oriented with the start of new municipal contracts and good volumes. Recycled prices at only minus 0.7% impact as the main drop of recycled prices happened in the second part of 2022. And our prices are more or less stabilized.

Hazardous Waste remained well oriented in almost all our geographies, and we continue to experience good pricing power in the U.S. Finally, on Slide 29, Energy activity decreased by 16.5% due to energy prices and the milder weather. Intrinsic energy growth was 1.1%. Thanks to our business model with index tariff and energy prices essentially passed through and thanks to our hedging policy, we have been able to protect our results. Energy EBITDA was quite stable in Q1 and should remain stable in the full year at a very high level. Weather was again unfavorable due to a very mild winter in Central Europe with an impact of minus 1%.

On our district heating business, as expected, we continued to benefit from heat price increases by the regulators in Central Europe as there is a lag effect. We also benefited from the ramp-up of our very large district heating contract in Tashkent.

On the electricity side, we benefited from our hedging policy, which enabled us to mitigate the market price evolution. We also started new high-efficiency cogeneration with higher EBITDA, such as Braunschweig in Germany and [indiscernible] in Czech Republic. And we have more to come with Poznan in Poland in 2025. Finally, we signed significant new energy efficiency contracts in Belgium, Italy, the Middle East and Hong Kong.

I'm now on Page 30, where you have our usual EBITDA bridge. We delivered a strong EBITDA growth of 5.7% like-for-like, fueled by the combination of the solid underlying revenue growth, strong efficiencies and synergies ahead of schedule.

In detail, scope included the disposal of Sade from March 1 and the integration of bolt-on assets in Germany. ForEx negative impact reached minus €58 million, mainly in Latin America.

Energy and recyclate impact was slightly negative, minus 1.8%, as we expected. EBITDA for Energy business was quite stable in Q1. Weather had an impact of minus 1.2% with the mild winter in Central Europe.

EBITDA intrinsic growth was, therefore, fueled by the following effect: a more robust commerce and volume impact for plus 3.6%, continuous strong net efficiency and synergies for 5.1%. The synergy delivery continues to be ahead of target, reaching €42 million in Q1 and €357 million accumulated since the closing of the acquisition of Suez, which is remarkable.

Moving to Slide 31. Let's see how the EBITDA increase is fueling the current EBIT, which is growing very strongly by 11.1% at €833 million. Renewable expense of €72 million are comparable with Q1 last year. Amortization, OFA and provision at €731 million is slightly down compared to 2023 with amortization slightly up due to the ramp-up of our contract in Uzbekistan and less impairment and provision than in 2023. JVs amounts to €22 million compared to €28 million last year, essentially due to a one-off in 2023.

Our net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. CapEx remained quite stable and included €95 million of decarbonization CapEx with good progress on our Poznan project and €43 million of Hazardous Waste new projects, particularly in the U.S., in the Middle East and in Germany.

The quarterly increase in net financial debt was due first to the seasonal reversal of working capital that was slightly higher than last year due to unfavorable calendar effects. It will not impact the free cash flow delivery of the year. We had higher payments in Q1 to water authorities in Water France and in CO2 products in Central Europe. And second, to the €200 million hybrid debt final repayment after the renewal of our €600 million hybrid debt in November last year.

Our solid investment-grade rating has just been confirmed by S&P and Moody's with a stable outlook.

Moving to Slide 33. To conclude, we, of course, confirm our ambitious guidance for 2024. Revenue, continued solid organic growth. For EBITDA, organic growth between 5% to 6%. More than €350 million of efficiency gains.

More than €400 million cumulated synergies at the end of 2024. Current net income above €1.5 billion, which means a double-digit growth compared to 2023. Leverage ratio below 3x. And as usual, our dividend will grow in line with our current EPS. Thank you for your attention.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Thank you, Claude. And now we are ready to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arthur Sitbon from Morgan Stanley.

Arthur Sitbon

So the first one would be on the synergies and cost savings. I see that the synergies in Q1 are quite strong compared to what you expect for the full year. So I was wondering if we should expect a normalization there in the next 3 quarters or if it's just that potentially you're going to deliver strong synergies on the year.

And on pretty much the same topic, on cost savings, the retention rate as well seems higher than usual, close to 45%. Was there anything unusual happening in Q1? Or is it what we can expect for the whole year? So that's the first question.

The second one is that you talk -- while it's been several months now that you talk a lot about your booster activities and your stronghold activities. I was wondering if there is any action that you may consider to accelerate the shift of your business profile towards more booster activities and a bit less stronghold to potentially accelerate the overall group growth profile of Veolia.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Two very different questions, but in a way, they very much summarize 2 of the 3 levers of our value creation, be it growth and efficiency and delivery on that.

So starting with synergies and cost savings. So yes, we've over-delivered in the first quarter. As usual, we will go on as fast as we can in delivering the synergies. Our commitment remains to deliver €500 million in 4 years. So at least €400 million by the end of this year. And we'll do it as quick as we can.

And I guess in terms of behind figures what is there, there are quite different things throughout the various years. The first year was very much the HQ type of savings. Typically, I don't know, real estate has emerged and 2 HQs in the same city in one same building. Then we moved to, say, more operational things. Typically, I don't know, in Australia, rebooting of trucks.

As you know, in Australia, we had like to 2 kind of similar in size activities in Waste, both in Suez and Veolia, which we've combined and so it's very operational. And I guess now we can see the benefits of the merger within the Water Tech zone, which was slightly delayed compared to, say, the Australia example and which I anticipate to go on for the next quarter. So no slowing down to anticipate in terms of the overall €500 million over 4 years, which we'll deliver as quick as we can.

And I guess, as you know, I'm kind of repeating myself on that one. I like to deliver on our promise and this is my priority as time goes. And in those days of uncertainties in the world, I think to be able to stick to the plan is something which has some merit.

In terms of cost savings, apart from synergies, who are traditional, shall I say, because it's become traditional to have cost savings, €300 million, which we've already enhanced from €200 million or €250 million, which was the initial type of figures to now €350 million per year.

I'm very happy that on top of the traditional cost-savings plans we have throughout all the business units of Veolia throughout the world, we are adding specific ones depending on the specific situation. And typically, I've highlighted briefly in my introduction words the France-specific action plan. France hasn't been -- I mean has been all right, but not great last year. And that's why we've launched a specific action plan, which is starting to bear fruit. Same applies with what I mentioned on exiting some underperforming contracts like the one in Canada.

So I guess, we're trying to be as agile as we can and we have been. And I guess, the next few years will be probably more of the same, plus, say, GenAI, typically, to fuel new ideas. And I tend to say kind of forever in Veolia, we always find new sources of efficiencies.

In terms of your second question on growth, we've announced our strategic plan a few weeks ago. And I guess your question is very much aligned with the strategic direction I've highlighted a few weeks ago, which is booster and stronghold, both are important.

In terms of stronghold, they account for roughly 70% of our revenue, the booster 30%. But in terms of investments, it will be the opposite way around and we expect the growth to come 70% from the boosters and only 30% from the stronghold. So I guess we put our money where our mouth is. And we already make a priority of those boosters, which doesn't mean that we forget the stronghold. And they are very important as well.

Why is that so? They are kind of the foundations on which we anchor, we build the boosters. If I give one example, without our, I would say, classical historic activities of dry waste and municipal water, we wouldn't be able to deliver the bioenergy production from waste or from wastewater, just to give one example, which is a booster. So the two are really intertwined very much.

And I guess when from the stronghold activities, the idea is to maintain our customer happy and to follow some growth. But say, it would be typically inflation plus 1%, what we expect from those type of activities. For the boosters, we're talking 5% to 10% or mid- to high single-digit growth, as we said. And I'm very happy that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter where our boosters have grown like exactly in this range and well above the average of the group in the first quarter. That's for the activities.

And for the geographies, the same applies. We said we are very happy with our history and geography, so France and Europe typically. But we will have a higher rate of growth in the U.S., in the Middle East and Australia and that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter. Claude mentioned the Australian growth, the American one as well. And each of those 3 geographic boosters have grown by above 6%, and as we've seen in Water Tech, it's even 15%.

So I guess, the priorities are translating into figures now and will be in the next few years. But I guess -- no, I was about to summarize in one more because my answer was very long. I guess it's resilience and growth, which we are aiming at delivering. Resilience comes from the strongholds. The growth comes from the boosters mainly, although you have a little bit of both in both activities, which means that when you say that a company like Veolia, which is long-term contracted activities, infrastructure-like in many ways, is able to deliver in the first quarter 3.9% in of revenue growth, I'm very happy about these results. And it's very, very much a testimony to your question about how to enhance growth. I think the figures demonstrate that.

Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Patel from Goldman Sachs.

Ajay Patel

Thank you very much for the presentation. I think my first sort of set of questions is on this teaser slide, on Slide 19, $200 billion estimated market. I don't think I, when I look at that, have the full appreciation of how Veolia's placed. I know that you have the range of technologies, but if you were to try to cater to that market, what will it take in regards to CapEx investment? What do you have already on the ground that can help to that solution?

And what potentially could you invest to take advantage of this opportunity? Just helping me sort of translate the big sort of number that you presented to actually nuts and bolts, somewhat sort of lower down.

And then I guess the second one is more granular, but just -- with an awful amount of wet weather, I just wondered potentially what could that mean in terms of the impact on water usage? Any sort of commentary around that would be helpful.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Sorry, I haven't understood your second question well enough.

Water usage. Okay, sorry, due to PFAS, you mean, or is it a totally separate question?

Ajay Patel

Sorry, separate question. The second one is separate, but just the first one, give us more on this PFAS. Does it sound like a massive opportunity? It's just it doesn't feel -- it doesn't -- I can't really frame it in my mind in regards to Veolia, yes.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Okay. Good. So two different questions on PFAS, which is the Page 19 you were referring to. I guess a few things on that one. This is about anticipation, positioning, patents and technologies and let me explain why.

PFAS, as you know, is quite an emerging market. That's why the numbers I've mentioned are publicized by third parties. As you know, they are our first estimate. But as I said, the legislation in the U.S. dates back from 3 weeks ago or something like that and it's still evolving and in Europe it's the same.

So it's difficult to assess with and to answer very, very precisely to your question. But there is a unique potential market, which we know will be very, very sizable. What we know as well is it's going to take a little bit of time because legislation translates into projects and then into delivery and then into margin for Veolia. So a little bit of it will see in this GreenUp plan and probably much more in the one after, given some of the time to deliver on those.

But the new opportunity is huge and we are uniquely positioned, that's for certain. How is that so? I detailed that in our deep dive in the U.S. a few weeks ago. So if you want to know more, I encourage you to watch the replay. But in a nutshell, PFAS, say, you can find it in many places in water as well as in soil and sites that you have to decontaminate.

So typically, if you see a map of the world, a map of the U.S. we've shown, a map of Europe, you see PFAS pretty much everywhere where you have large industrial chemical parks as well as every single airport and airbase, basically. And you can see a map where you have PFAS.

How do you treat those? You have usually to concentrate and this is with membranes or resins. It happens that we are #1 in those technologies with Water Tech business. Then you have to, say, treat as in -- I was about to say destroy and cut into pieces. And this is with our high-temperature incinerator, which typically can do that.

High-temperature incinerator, meaning 150 degrees Celsius, just to give you an idea what I mean by high temperature, which our Hazardous Waste business.

So in a way, this is an example where we have the municipal water activity, the Water Technologies like in resins and membranes as well as the Hazardous Waste business, and we are the leaders in every single of those three businesses, actually #1 in each of the three actually in the world and in the various geographies I've just mentioned.

So in a way, we have competitors, of course, in each of those segments. I really believe in each of those segments we are the best. But what's very unique is our ability to offer the full range, the end-to-end solution. And I cannot see anyone offering the end-to-end solution.

And why is it so important? It means that for customers, you would need resin, in another one you would need membrane, for the third one you have go directly to a high-temperature incinerator or whatever because every single situation is different if you talk about an airport pollution, if you talk about a refinery or if you talk about water. So this is really an example of an ecology of solutions, which is, Mr. Customer, you have a problem. We manage to design a solution to fit your needs and we have the full portfolio from end-to-end again.

So difficult to assess how speed -- how quick, I guess, this market will translate into our figures because, again, the legislation is very, very recent. But given what I said, we know which we have a unique opportunity here to offer what we do very well and what we're the leader of.

We already have some contracts we signed because some customers have anticipated the legislation in a way. So it's typically the Department of Defense in Australia or some specific customers in the U.S. and it even started in Europe, so we have already had a few contracts. They are not significant in numbers as in we're talking millions of euros or dozens of millions, no more, so far. But it's moving super, super quick.

On the second question, which is the water usage. If your question is about billing between weather and water usage, I would like to try and understand better your question to be able to answer more precisely if you can. Was that restriction of water -- water restriction you mean or water quality? Or tell me.

Ajay Patel

I was just thinking the weather seems to have been quite wet. And to what extent could that impact your Waste volumes in the second half of the year or over the remaining quarters so that it could be a benefit to you?

Estelle Brachlianoff

I guess the Waste volume, you probably mean the Water volume?

Yes, yes. Just -- Okay. So you always have a little bit of weather impact in Veolia. That's why we have shown you on the various bridge that Claude has what we call the interesting growth, which is the self-help, if you want, from growing our activities and efficiency. And we've had a negative weather effect in the winter, so we may have a positive or negative weather in the summer. I can tell you that whatever is the summer like, I commit on delivering on the guidance I repeated. So that's the usual one.

Second -- so that's the short-term answer. So we can confirm the guidance, whatever. The second answer is on the, I guess, midterm trends. It's fair to say that the summary of '22 in France, the summer of '23 in the U.K. and I could go on like that and in Spain and so on and so forth means that it was such a shocker for municipalities and populations and industries alike that even when it rains, the push for solutions, be the reduction of [indiscernible] or reuse of wastewater and all the rest of it is still very much top of the list of our customers.

So it's good news that it has rained, so the underground water are now a bit more full than they were a few weeks ago. But I can tell you, our customers are still very, very, very adamant to find solution because everybody has perfectly understood that this type of event is here to stay and even to reinforce because it's the first consequence of global warming, basically.

A testimony to that is the survey we've conducted with Elabe in 24 countries with 26,000 people in the world, which we've just released the results a few weeks ago, where the population -- everyone in the world basically has understood that we need solution as in now. And I can tell you whatever the weather is like, this is here to stay.

So we are on a megatrend, which I'm very confident is here to stay because it's pushed the demand from the population itself.

Our next question comes from the line of Olly Jeffery from Deutsche Bank.

Olly Jeffery

So a couple of questions. First one, I'd just like to think about how you're seeing the rest of the year in terms of the outlook for Waste growth in China and Europe, given the economic picture is looking slightly better for those regions. So are you seeing any evidence of that yet because I know that in China, obviously, it's been slightly depressed for your business there.

And the other question I have was around just the specifics within the DNA. So industrial capital gains and net provisions are up €31 million versus €10 million last year. Can you just explain what's driving that, please?

And my last question is for the full year is €100 million FX headwind at the EBITDA level still the right order of magnitude? Or have things improved a little bit with the movement in the Chilean peso recently?

Estelle Brachlianoff

Sorry, I don't think I heard well the third question. Okay. EBITDA to EBIT, okay, sorry.

On the first one, the rest of the year. So we see no change in the Waste activities. So the Waste activities, as you can see, has been well performing in the start of the year, plus 5.5% in terms of revenue. And in April, we have the same -- and the start of the May, we have the same trend as in Q1. So we are starting the year very well on the Waste activity.

And so far, so good. The current trending is the same as we speak, as what we have seen in Q1. And for China, this is one of your question. We had -- the China solid waste was better than the start of the year, especially on plastic recycling. So we had a slightly better momentum in China.

In terms of quality of earnings, if this is your question, and the EBITDA to EBIT transmission. As I said in Q1, we have slightly more amortization than last year with the ramp-up of the Tashkent contract, so a little bit more depreciation and amortization.

On the provision side, the main topic was a provision that we had to take last year to cover the risk for a contract ending for around €20 million, and we had no such risk to cover in Q1 2024, which is good news. And on the other side, for the JVs, we had a positive one-off in 2023 and no such thing in 2024.

So if you look at EBITDA, EBITDA has increased by €50 million. And it translates directly into EBIT level at €55 million, so the same amount if you compare to the EBITDA evolution and the EBIT evolution.

Estelle Brachlianoff

And just to complement Claude's answer on the first question. As we've said, we are 85%, we think something like that, immune to macro, which means that, in a way, I would differentiate a little bit Veolia's result from the GDP results and how the economy is going to countries you mentioned. In a way, I can comment on China GDP, but I'd rather comment on Veolia growth in Europe or in China, which were your two questions. And again, we are -- we have some very limited impact of the GDP, say, the 15%. But more interestingly, there is a part of it which is more commerce.

And it's fair to say in some geographies, it's difficult for us to distinguish. Say, the Waste volume is a little bit up in the first quarter as you've seen by 1-point-something percent, 1.2%. And part of it is probably the economy doing a little bit better, and part of it is us being better than the competition.

How do I split both? You know what? It's very difficult to say. And we've seen in some geographies, our competitors complaining and us being relatively happy because our job is to try, and again, like win valuable business and not only just to follow what the economy tells us. China being a good example, we've put a specific action plan in place. So we are not waiting for the rebound of the industry in China. We've put some action plan in place.

So EBITDA is on the up, although revenue is not. I mean, it's kind of flat minus, something like that. But we have the EBITDA on the up because again I would distinguish the macro picture and whether Veolia delivers from it.

Olly Jeffery

That's clear. And just following up on the last question on the FX impact. I think before, you've spoken about €100 million for the full year at the EBITDA level. Is that still the right level to think about? And what should we think about the net income line because obviously a lot of that comes out through minorities. It might be helpful just to clarify on that bit, too.

Claude Laruelle

Okay. So for ForEx impact, we said between €70 million and €80 million if the currency stays at the same level, Olly. And the impact that net income will be super small. So whatever the ForEx, we can fully confirm that the net income will be above €1.5 billion at year-end.

Our next question comes from the line of Jenny Ping from Citi.

Jenny Ping

I've got two questions, please. Just firstly, just going back to the PFAS point, can I ask what is the EPA regulation in terms of the removal rate because my understanding is that it's quite difficult for total removal of any PFAS substances in the water.

And then secondly, linked to that, if I can also ask whether you guys have your own proprietary technology, i.e., competitive edge for the removal process, that would be great.

And then just alongside of that, if I can ask for a bit more color around the recyclate prices and commodities movements that you've seen recently. Normally, you have the chart in the back of your pack, which shows the movements in commodity prices and recyclates, but I don't think it's there. So if you can give some commentary around that would be great.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Thank you. So on PFAS, I would -- again, sorry, I encourage you to have a look at our replay on the U.S. deep dive, which will explain the whole detail of the EPA legislation, which had been released a few days before we've done this deep dive.

I won't go into very much detail. We had two different sets of legislation so far, I mean, if I call EPA legislation, it's more standard than legislation, as such. The first one was on potable water and the second one was more on polluted soil and such, if you want, called [indiscernible]. And in both cases, you're right, it's very difficult to talk about total renewable.

So there is a list of specific PFAS because, as you know, PFAS is a family of products, some of them being very likely [indiscernible] some of them very, very likely not. And it's not for me to decide. It's the sanitary and health authorities which decide that. And It has translated into a specific list of a few PFAS, where the combined pollution level, if you want, has to be detected below a certain threshold.

And I guess, so just to give you a metaphor. The threshold is very small, but it's not 0 because, as you said, the total renewable is difficult. But it's so small, it's the equivalent of the size of a sugar cube in the middle of an Olympic swimming pool, just to give you the idea of the type of threshold the legislation has said will be -- have to be implemented in the next 5 years.

Do we have our own technology? Yes, we do and they are patented. Again, resin, patented; membrane, patented; and very unique as well set of technologies in the high-temperature incinerator, which are above 1,100 degrees, as I mentioned. So yes, it's patented technologies and quite unique. And as you know, in those three, we are #1 player in the world, #1 player in Water Tech in the U.S.

As well and #2 in the Hazardous Waste, so just to mention the U.S. And same applies with Europe, we are #1 in Water Tech and #1 in Hazardous Waste in Europe just the same. So yes, we have our own technologies to treat those. But as I mentioned earlier on, it's not only our technology, it's a set of technologies and the broadness of the end-to-end solution, combining the Water Tech, the Hazardous Waste, which makes us very unique. In terms of recyclate price and commodities, Claude, do you want to comment?

Claude Laruelle

So recyclate, the main topic for us is the paper and cardboard. What we are seeing in the -- you know it has dropped a lot, as I said, in the second part of 2022. After, we have seen a low price since -- during the course of 2023. We have seen a slightly up movement in Q1, especially in the month of March, which is really encouraging for the rest of the year. So we see a movement up in recyclates as we speak.

Estelle Brachlianoff

So it's -- but it's a limited one. So I guess our job is to deliver the result irrespective of the commodities price in a way, be it recyclates or be it energy, as I mentioned in my introduction speech.

And the plastic price is, I guess, average low. So I guess do we have a potential for improvement in the next few years? Yes, we do. The price released still relatively low as we speak. When is it going to happen?

I won't make any bet on that because it's always difficult to predict any commodities, but our commitment is on delivering on our guidance.

We have our next question coming from the line of Alexandre Roncier from Bank of America.

Alexandre Roncier

I've got two, please. The first one is just a follow-up on the EBITDA to EBIT bridge. I think in your press release, you mentioned capital gains. So that was just to confirm the size of them, and if anything material was coming out of Sade for the quarter?

And then the second one is I was looking at your free cash flow, and obviously, there's some phasing quarter-over-quarter and within the year. But I think you mentioned in your press release again some disbursement from carbon. And I was just wondering really the movements there, given that carbon prices are quite much lower year-over-year. And I would have expected perhaps lower by given the mild winter in your district heating business.

So maybe if you can talk about the different driving forces there or if you were maybe a bit more tactical as other industrial players have been, I think, within the market for carbon buying.

Claude Laruelle

Okay. So on the capital gain that was very minimal because, as you know, on the EBIT level we record only the industrial capital gains, so that was only a few millions. So nothing relevant in terms of capital gains for the EBITDA to EBIT translation.

In terms of free cash flow, in terms of -- and Sade capital gain will be below EBIT and will be released during the H1 results, but it's a positive one, I can confirm.

In terms of free cash flow and the CO2. So it's a matter of calendar. So as I said, it's just a calendar effect. In CO2, as you know, we have a hedging policy, the same hedging policy in terms of CO2 as what we have on energy. Because we don't want to take market risk, so we hedge when we sell the energy in the market, we hedge the CO2 in the meantime.

So we have a CO2 price, which is slightly above the market today, but we are buying CO2 on the market for the years to come and that will be also good news for our Energy business in 2025 and in 2026.

And in terms of payments, it's just, as I said, the calendar effect Q1 versus the end of the year. So no impact on the delivery of free cash flow regarding this calendar effect.

Our next question comes from the line of Juan Rodriguez from Kepler.

Juan Rodriguez

I have two in my side, if I may. The first one is, again, coming back on working capital and this seasonal, but increasing effect. I just want to confirm that you're expecting the end of the year towards normalization and relatively flat?

And the second on this working cap is on the higher CO2 quotas. I want to confirm that it does not include U.K. as there was kind -- has been a recent article signaling a possible cost increase on incinerators in the country. So this is the first one -- kind of 1.2 question.

And the second one is on acquisition. So if you can give us more color on the acquisition price and valuation of Hofmann in Germany and any color as well on the price evaluation of the Uniper CGT assets in Hungary will be helpful.

Claude Laruelle

So I'll start with the working capital. So no topic about the U.K. So it's not a topic at all on the working capital.

And in terms of -- yes, we will reverse the working capital at year-end as usual, Juan. It's -- and we know that we start always with Q1 with a stronger negative working capital and it's always reversed progressively in Q3 and Q4. So no change regarding working capital for Veolia. Estelle...

Estelle Brachlianoff

Yes. On the others, so as you know, the U.K. CO2 for incineration, which was your second question, we're talking 2028, if, so going into the ETS scheme. So nothing to do with neither this year nor the years of the GreenUp plan.

But in anticipation, in a way, we knew it were likely to come. Hence, we've started a few projects to capture CO2 from our incinerator, which is a very specific CO2, as I explained in London, actually following a question I had on that one because it's biogenic CO2, which is in a way that kind of, let's call it, the good CO2 as opposed to the bad CO2, which is a non-biogenic one. So no impact at all to expect.

And by the way, the various costs will be bear-ed eventually by the municipalities in the end, not by Veolia. But we want to help, and therefore, we've launched a few projects. And you can see a press release in the U.K. about CO2 capture and storage and so on and so forth.

In terms of the Uniper and off-line prices, there is a reason why we don't publish the price. And usually, it's because the sellers don't want us to. And I guess you can see that it's usually good news when the sellers doesn't want to publish the price of an acquisition made by Veolia. For us, I mean, good news for us. I guess, I will stay there, but highly value creative.

So I think it's a very good example of, what I call, the third pillar of our value creation, which is, I guess, the optimization of the balance sheet and the portfolio of activities while constantly reviewing the plus and the minuses. And on those two, which are on the acquisition side, quick value creation because it's synergistic in both cases with our existing activities, in one case in Germany recycling; and the other one, flexibility in Hungary, which we do already have activities in Hungary in the same type of things.

So value creation, relatively quick. I would say, a little bit plug and play, if you allow me the metaphor. So quite good illustration of that. So it's going to be value creation relatively quickly.

Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Palliez from CIBC Market Solutions -- sorry, CIC Market Solutions.

Arnaud Palliez

I have just one remaining follow-up question on the changes in scope. Can you give us the impact on full year revenue and margin for the acquisitions of Uniper and Hofmann -- or the deal with Uniper. And a reminder also about Morocco, Lydec, what can be the impact on annual sales and margin? And the same question on the disposal side regarding the Italian water concessions.

Estelle Brachlianoff

So you made a quite a long list on the plus side, Uniper and Hofmann. On the minus side, Italia and maybe the Lydec one. So if I summarize all that is included in our guidance for the year, obviously. And whatever the date I'm going to briefly detail, I guess it won't change our €1.5 billion net result target, I would say, in absolute value irrespective of the scope for the end of the year. I think that's the important bit.

So you have the plus and the minuses compensated. And altogether, of course, we expect all that to create value and be a plus.

Uniper is not closed yet. We're talking about later in the year, probably the autumn, something like that. Hofmann, it will be in the account, I think, it varies, a little bit in Q1 and there will be the rest in Q2 onwards.

Lydec, I guess, no impact on net results because it's very, very, I guess, limiting in terms of net results contribution.

And in terms of Sade, in a way, it has a large impact on revenue, but not on margins because, as I said, we're talking about an EBITDA percentage of roughly around 5%. So it's a good business. And the reason why we've sold it is not the 5%, it's a good performance for a construction type of business. But we're not keen to keep construction businesses, as we've highlighted a few times.

And Italia, it was not consolidated because it was a series of minority shares where we didn't have an operational impact on and that's exactly why we sold. So it's a very different situation and very small.

Claude Laruelle

Very small EBIT impact, nonsignificant. Absolutely nonsignificant at group level. So very happy.

Estelle Brachlianoff

That's why all that -- so yes, so all that will again contribute to the €1.5 billion target at current.

And our last question comes from the line of Philippe Ourpatian from ODDO BHF.

Philippe Ourpatian

Yes. I have two follow-up questions. The first one is concerning ForEx. You confirmed a €70 million, €80 million impact. But just could we have, as it's very difficult and mainly linked to Argentina where the situation is a little bit troubled view from Europe, could you just have a kind of sensitivity about what's going to happen if, let's say, your forecast in terms of Argentinian pesos is not exactly aligned with the figure at the end of the year as you are accounting through inflationary-trained accounting principle.

It means that you are taking, let's say, the last day of the quarter or the full year. And just to have a kind of sensitivity concerning the main LatAm ForEx impact at the EBITDA level, please? That's the first one.

And the second one is in the Slide 30, you mentioned some good retention rate. When I'm taking the €33 million net efficiencies, let's say, and the €88 million on the gross value, it seems that we are always around the 50%. Is this means that we are starting to have a better retention rate in terms of efficiency versus the past? Or is it something specific to Q1?

Claude Laruelle

Okay. So maybe on the first one, the best guess that we can make, Philippe, is to take the actual assumption with the actual exchange rate and have a projection on the full year. Argentinian business is very small and EBITDA is very small, so it will not have additional significant impact when you have the full year with the hyperinflation in December resetting the entire year of ForEx impact. So because it's small, we don't expect this to be at the end of the year material in terms of ForEx impact in Argentina. That's what we see today.

Estelle Brachlianoff

So on the retention rate, which is your second question, it made me realize that I didn't answer on that question already asked a few minutes ago. Yes, you're right, 38 divided by 88 is now 43% than 50%. But nevertheless, it's on the upper part of our range, which we said is always between 30% and 50% depending on the quarters.

So does it mean that we'll stay at this type of range as in 43%? You know, 30% to 50% is traditional for us, so I guess the middle part of the range is a good assumption for me going forward. And the specificity of Q1 was more what I mentioned on the Water Tech, which was really, I guess, volume-based and growth-based rather than, I guess, SG&A, which at times necessitates a bit of cost to be able to extract efficiencies.

So I guess the retention rate depends more on the type of efficiency than anything else. When you're talking SG&A at times, you have a bit to pay to get them extracted. Therefore, the net is a little bit on the lower range.

When you talk about, say, purchasing, it's more on the upper end of the range. And the mix makes it different from quarter to the other. And the upper part of the range is due, again, mainly on the Water Tech efficiency plan in the first quarter.

Philippe Ourpatian

Yet in fact, my question was also linked to the GreenUp strategy. It means that are you forecasting to have a better, maybe, retention rate due to this, let's say, new strategy more -- mainly focused on having additional value, making more complex, let's say, technical contract and so on? That's also part of my question.

Estelle Brachlianoff

So I guess, the way to see the GreenUp objective is €300 million per year plus the second part of the synergies, of course, plus the top line growth, all that fueling EBITDA. So in a way, what is important for me is really the 6% average basically growth of EBITDA, which we've published which is 8% -- sorry, €8 billion EBITDA target for 2027.

I guess this is more the figure because you have pluses and minuses. Of course, if we can retain more in efficiency plan, we will. But we can have weather impact as well as we've seen in this quarter or not great commodities, so I guess you have pluses and minuses. That's why the way to see it is really the target of EBITDA and the target even more so in net results, which is 10% on average over the duration of the plan. I guess that's what the attention is focused on.

And usually at Veolia, when we have a specific things happening, we react with an extra specific plan as we've done particularly in France, which is starting to bear fruit. So I guess, instead of talking about average of retention, I'd rather [indiscernible] on, again, net results over the duration of the plan, which is what we are focusing our attention upon with EPS in line in terms of growth.

Thank you. There seems to be no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brachlianoff for final closing comments.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Thank you very much for attending this conference call. And again, very good result, which helps me to see 2024 with great confidence and confirm our objective for the year and a very good start of our GreenUp plan. Thank you.

Thank you, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Batteries are broadly classified into two categories, namely primary batteries and secondary batteries. Primary batteries, also known as use-and-throw batteries, can only be charged once and are discarded when completely discharged due to irreversible electrochemical reactions. They are also known as rechargeable batteries. On the other hand, secondary batteries, also known as rechargeable batteries, can be charged and reused for multiple cycles. These batteries are reversible, allowing for the creation of products and electricity when discharging. The flow of electrons into the battery facilitates the reverse reaction, where the products react to form the reactants. Both primary and secondary batteries are essential for various applications.

Battery Market Trend Analysis

The burgeoning demand for electric vehicles (EVs) serves as a pivotal catalyst propelling the battery market forward. This surge can be attributed to several factors. Global apprehensions regarding climate change and air pollution have spurred governments worldwide to enact stringent emission regulations and offer incentives to promote the adoption of zero-emission vehicles like EVs. These regulatory measures, combined with advancements in battery technology, have significantly heightened the appeal of EVs among consumers.

The battery market stands to benefit significantly from the integration of renewable energy sources. With the global shift towards cleaner and more sustainable energy generation, technologies like solar and wind power are gaining traction. However, these sources are subject to intermittency, meaning they produce electricity only when environmental conditions allow. This misalignment with demand poses a challenge.

According to Gravitricity, its energy storage system, called GraviStore, uses heavy weights - totalling up to 12,000 tonnes - suspended in a deep shaft by cables attached to winches. When there is excess electricity, for example on a windy day, the weight is winched to the top of the shaft ready to generate power.

This weight can then be released when required - in less than a second - and the winches become generators, producing either a large burst of electricity quickly, or releasing it more slowly depending on what is needed.

""The system offers many of the best characteristics of pumped storage hydro and lithium-ion batteries - but unlike batteries, the Gravitricity system can operate for decades without any reduction in performance,"" the firm said in a media statement.

Among the company's clients are the Velenje coal mine in northeastern Slovenia, which is owned and operated by government-owned Premogovnik Velenje; First Quantum Mineral's Pyhäsalmi mine - Europe's deepest zinc and copper mine - in central Finland; the former Darkov mine in the Czech Republic, which is being decommissioned by DIAMO, the Czech state enterprise in charge of mitigating the consequences of uranium ore and coal mining; and the Geiger Group's Grube Teutschenthal mine near Halle, central Germany.

""Gravity energy storage offers a powerful green opportunity to mine operators looking to extend a mine's life beyond the extraction of materials. As well as being a genuine alternative to decommissioning, new underground energy storage schemes can provide economic and employment opportunities in communities where traditional jobs are in decline,"" Gravitricity founder and executive chairman, Martin Wright, said. ""Our work with mine operators is underlining the interest in our technology, and we are in dialogue with both mine owners and public sector organizations to turn these studies into operational plans.""

Wright pointed out that Gravitricity has already demonstrated its GraviStore technology with an above-ground 250kW demonstrator, where the company successfully raised and lowered two 25-tonne weights to generate full power and verify the system's speed of response.

The £1-million, 12-metre-high test rig proved the system can go from zero to full power in less than a second - which can be extremely valuable in the frequency response and backup power markets -, while it also has the ability to vary power output dependent on demand.",mining.com,news,MINING.COM,,0.223529411764706,453387892,4,https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pyhasalmi-mine-3.jpg,

The production of a unit of GDP in many countries of the Three Seas Initiative has been more costly than in Western Europe. Therefore, these states are striving to align their economic and energy policies with the EU standards.

The Three Seas region is a group of countries that vary in geography, climate, economy, and economic resources. Each of them uses different sources of energy and emits different amounts of greenhouse gases. To show how diverse the Three Seas region is, let us look at some of the countries in this group. Lithuania relies mainly on gas, biofuels, and renewables, and seeks to diversify its energy sources. It has no intention to build nuclear plants shortly, though. Similarly, Estonia's parliament adopted a renewable electricity target of 100 percent by 2030. Contrary to what it may seem, Hungary's energy system has a relatively low carbon intensity. The country relies on coal for only about a dozen or so of its energy mix. State authorities plan to increase their use of renewable energy sources and invest in new nuclear reactors at the Paks power plant. Hungary increased its solar power capacity by nearly 1 gigawatt in 2022. The Czech Republic is also phasing out coal and expanding its nuclear energy sector to secure its energy independence.

The Three Seas countries and other Central and Eastern European nations are undergoing a fast energy transition, driven by the EU's stricter climate policy. Diversifying energy sources became more important after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. As the Kremlin's influence in the region has weakened over the past two years, energy prices have risen, especially for fossil fuels that were once largely imported from the east. One thing is certain: the region is undergoing a transformation that will involve reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

The region has a lot of scope for developing renewable technologies, even though coal and gas have been and still are the main sources of energy for many of its economies. Offshore wind power plants are very feasible for the countries on the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. Northern countries like Poland and the Baltic states can invest in both offshore and onshore energy, even though they use different types of energy sources. Conversely, countries like Slovenia, Romania, and Hungary, which are situated in the central-southern region of the Three Seas, are known for their significant potential in producing solar energy. The advancement of renewable energy sources is crucial for the Three Seas Initiative because it can help mitigate the continuous increase in energy costs. In the journey of energy transition, particularly for economies heavily reliant on coal, gas serves as an excellent bridge fuel. This is evident from the investments made by countries in the region, such as the doubling of the LNG terminal capacity in Croatia, the construction of the FSRU terminal near Gdańsk, and the expansion of the Polish LNG terminal's capacity from 5 to 8.3 billion cubic meters annually.

Without a doubt, the year 2030 will be a significant milestone for Europe in terms of both political and climate-related developments. In the political sphere, there is a growing discussion within the EU forum about plans to extend the union by incorporating a country from the Western Balkans. In terms of climate and energy policies, 2030 marks the completion of certain frameworks established by the European Union. Indeed, it is important to acknowledge that within a strict framework, certain countries may struggle to meet their individual objectives. Indeed, if we expand our view beyond just the Three Seas countries, and if the economic and energy development in Central and Eastern Europe continues at its current pace, with transformations that are equitable and customized to each economy, we could anticipate a significant increase in the capacity of wind and solar power plants in this region. The capacity could rise from the current 35 gigawatts to 196 gigawatts by 2030. This increase could potentially reduce energy prices by up to a third and enable the export of up to 20 gigawatts of electricity post-2030. In 2022 alone, the total capacity of solar and wind power plants in Central and Eastern Europe saw an increase of less than 30 percent. This suggests a potential for this trend to continue, further contributing to the region's energy development and transformation.

There is a clear political desire for transformation within the energy sector in the countries involved in the Three Seas Initiative. It is important to note that in the Central and Eastern European region, political support is significantly influenced by energy prices. This, in turn, affects the stance of individual governments towards investments in the energy sector. The Baltic states have set a goal to disconnect their energy systems from the Russian grid by 2025. Following this, they plan to subsequently connect to the continental European grid. Indeed, Latvia and Estonia are also participating in the development of offshore wind farms. Another noteworthy example is the collaboration between Hungary and Romania, along with Azerbaijan and Georgia. They have signed a memorandum to develop an underwater electric cable that will run through the Black Sea. The investment is intended to bolster the export of energy to Europe. Hungary is a country that has significant geothermal potential. As a testament to this, the first geothermal power plant was connected to their national grid in late 2017. An excellent illustration of future collaboration is the proposal by Romania and Bulgaria to construct a shared energy island. For Poland, which has an economy heavily reliant on coal, there have been numerous investments and strategies developed in recent years. The goal of these initiatives is to attain energy independence and ensure a stable supply of natural gas to the Central and Eastern Europe region. Several significant projects stand out, including the Baltic Pipe, the enlargement of the LNG terminal in Świnoujście, the introduction of a new FSRU terminal, the development of nuclear reactors in collaboration with the United States and South Korea, and the implementation of small modular reactors (SMRs).

The success of the energy transition not only relies on top-down decisions but also significantly depends on the collaborative efforts of the private sector, the public sector, and the general public. An excellent illustration of public involvement is the widespread support for the ""My Electricity"" government program in Poland. The initiative aimed to offer a co-funding sum of as much as PLN 5,000 for the setup of solar panel systems in domestic houses. The considerable interest shown by the beneficiaries led to the construction of close to 10 gigawatts of photovoltaic energy between 2020 and 2023.

The partnership within the Three Seas Initiative is consistently progressing and it is undeniably a framework that deserves consideration, especially in the light of the current geopolitical system. Moving forward, the significance of investments in interconnectors cannot be overstated. Such investments will facilitate the delivery of electricity, produced from offshore wind energy at sea, to areas of demand. This calls for, among other initiatives, the deployment of bridging systems and the expansion of cross-border networks to harness the advantages. In addition, the transition of many countries to nuclear energy can benefit others. This is because nuclear power stations in a particular country can have a substantial impact on the regional energy composition, especially through grid interconnections.",warsawinstitute.org,news,Warsaw Institute,,0.3098039215686275,453371692,11,https://warsawinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zrzut-ekranu-2024-05-10-172717.png,eng-9562835

ČEZ Group confirmed its full-year outlook for 2024: EBITDA between CZK 115 and 120 bn. and an adjusted net profit between CZK 25 and 30 bn.

""ČEZ Group's Q1 financial results accord with our expectations and reflect gradual stabilisation in energy markets. Price stabilisation is evidenced by the fact that, at the beginning of April, we paid off the last billion EUR of a specific loan agreement with the Czech State, which provided a total of EUR 3 bn. to us in 2022, for covering extraordinary margining requirements, i.e., the obligation to supply substantial funds for securing trading in energy commodities,"" said Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO of ČEZ Daniel Beneš, adding: ""The future of the Czech energy sector will be based on renewable sources and safe nuclear energy. A major milestone came in the development of nuclear energy in the Czech Republic in April, as the European Commission approved state aid for a new nuclear unit in Dukovany. On the same day, we received updated bids from both bidders for the construction of the new nuclear units.""

Operating income in Q1 was down by CZK 6.0 bn. year on year, to CZK 87.4 bn. Operating income before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was up by CZK 7.8 bn. year on year, to CZK 40.3 bn. The year-on-year comparison was impacted by levies on excess production revenues that added CZK 10 bn. to Q1 2023 costs. On the other hand, the decrease in power generation margin in particular had a negative effect, given the reduction in electricity realisation prices and the growth in the purchase price of emission allowances.

Power generation from renewable and nuclear sources was down by 3% year on year. Whereas renewable sources produced 0.2 TWh more electricity, particularly thanks to above-average hydrological conditions and higher use of pumped-storage hydro power plants, generation from nuclear sources was down by 0.5 TWh, due to the different schedules of planned outages of nuclear power plants.

Electricity consumption in the distribution territory of ČEZ Distribuce decreased by 1% year on year, to 9.3 TWh, with household consumption being down by 2%, primarily on account of the warm weather in Q1 2024. Total climate- and calendar-adjusted electricity consumption was up by 1% year on year, to 9.8 TWh.

Hai Phong, China's Shangyu district boost trade, investment

The Hai Phong Economic Zone Authority (HEZA) and Shangyu district of Shaoxing city, Zhejiang province, China embarked on a collaborative effort to strengthen trade and cultural exchanges through a letter of intent signed on May 13.

Under the letter, both sides will encourage and facilitate business partnerships, foster a business-friendly environment and protect investors' rights and interests, and regularly share management experience and investment policies to promptly address difficulties faced by companies engaged in production and trade.

Head of the HEZA Le Trung Kien expressed his hope for the establishment of a formal twinning relationship between Hai Phong and Shangyu to further solidify this partnership.

Chief of Shangyu district Jin Jinfu said his locality has companies strong in hi-tech manufacturing, an area that aligns with Hai Phong's investment priorities so that the district is looking forward to promoting investment opportunities between the both sides.

The HEZA reported that Hai Phong now boasts 210 Chinese-invested projects with a combined capital of 5.6 billion USD. They are mostly in electricity, electronics, apparel, leather and footwear, and plastics, generating jobs to over 58,000 workers. Notably, Hai Phong is home to two industrial zones - Do Son and An Duong - that house a significant number of Chinese-invested enterprises./.

Southeast Asian steel exhibition gets underway in Da Nang

The Southeast Asia Iron and Steel Institute (SEAISI) Conference & Exhibition 2024 opened on May 13 in the central coastal city of Da Nang, with the event offering Vietnamese firms the chance to introduce their operations and the local steel industry.

Upon addressing the event, Nghiem Xuan Da, chairman of the Vietnam Steel Association, emphasized that the event themed ""Surviving and thriving in the decarbonized world"", is expected to provide an ideal platform for representatives from various nations to share technologies and innovations towards green and circular economic development.

He underlined the need to accelerate the transition towards a green economy, which is an inevitable trend as part of efforts to meet market demands.

Furthermore, he underscored the importance of renovating technologies rapidly in a bid to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, as well as applying artificial intelligence to improve productivity in order to ensure social and environmental responsibility.

Countries must therefore work together in a bid to ensure equitable development, whilst also making commitments to deploy drastic actions in response to climate change in many different contexts, he said, adding that steel companies in the nation must exert every effort as they seek to reduce carbon emissions and save energy in the future.

At the conference, international and domestic business representatives, experts, and scientists all came together to exchange information on policies and legal regulations of Vietnam, the region, and the world with the aim of helping steel enterprises to devise proper business plans in accordance with the country's green growth strategy.

Thanh Ha lychees to be transported to Australia by air

The first batch of Thanh Ha lychees from the northern province of Hai Duong is set to be transported to Australia by air on May 14, according to details given by Red Dragon Service Trading Manufacture Company Limited.

Australia represents a traditional market that has consumed Thanh Ha lychees for several years. Currently, the firm has been processing about one tonne of Thanh Ha lychees for export to the Australian market, with the fruit products fully meeting VietGAP and GlobalGAP standards.

After going through preliminary processing, the lychee batch will be irradiated on May 13 in order to meet quarantine criteria before being exported to Australia by air on May 14.

According to the schedule, the firm will purchase between 10 tonnes and 15 tonnes of lychees for export as the harvest seasons begins.

Red Dragon Service Trading Manufacture Company Limited specialises in exporting Thanh Ha lychees to major markets such as Japan, the United States, the Netherlands, Canada, and Australia.

This year will see the enterprise continue to invite Japanese experts to strictly supervise the quality of lychees and co-ordinate efforts in introducing Thanh Ha lychees into Japan's Aeon supermarket chain.

Over recent years, aside from being consumed within the domestic market, Thanh Ha lychee has been shipped to a number of high-end markets such as China, Japan, France, the US, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan (China), Belgium, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Thailand, Singapore along with several countries in the Middle East and ASEAN.

Compliance risk management to be enhanced to prevent tax evasion in a digital economy

The tax administrations will enhance tax compliance risk management to prevent evasions in a digital economy, Đặng Ngọc Minh, Deputy Director of the General Department of Taxation told a conference on Monday.

The department's statistics showed that there are nearly one million enterprises, three million business households and 27 million individuals subject to individual income tax in Việt Nam.

The rapid development of science and technology, especially the explosion of the Internet and digital platforms, has created a digital economy full of potential and opportunities for socio-economic development, Minh said.

However, he added, there are also risks for tax management.

To that end, the tax administrations have focused on tax compliance risk management with the development of criteria, a supervision system for e-invoice issuance as well as the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to detect unusual risks.

According to Ngô Thị Thuỳ Linh, Depute Head of the Risk Management Department under the General Department of Taxation, tax compliance risk management is a modern tax management method that is being applied by many countries around the world when the number of taxpayers is increasing rapidly, and the business operation is becoming more complicated for tax management.

Risk-based management will have the tax watchdogs use their resources more effectively and focus on groups of taxpayers with higher risks for tax evasion, Linh said.

The data has been centralised at the General Department of Taxation, which will serve as the base for risk analysis, she said.

For taxpayers who are individuals and business households, the tax administration is developing a set of criteria indicators for compliance risk management which is expected to be issued within this year, she said.

It is necessary to improve the legal framework on tax compliance risk management with an aim to encourage taxpayers to comply with the established regulations.

Nguyễn Thị Cúc, President of Việt Nam Tax Consultants Association, said risk analysis will help tax administration to classify taxpayers in accordance with their levels of tax compliance for appropriate management solutions.

Emulations and rewards should be carried out for highly compliant taxpayers together with other tax incentives such as tax references and fewer inspections to encourage compliance.

The application of information and technology should also be enhanced to facilitate tax payment.

""The better is the tax management, the higher the compliance, the more transparent is the business environment,"" Cúc stressed.

Business conditions numerous and cumbersome: CIEM

Major hurdles must be overcome to simplify and streamline regulations governing economic activities, according to the latest report by the Central Institute of Economic Management (CIEM).

The report showed a large number of conditional business lines, far exceeding the official number of 229. Explaining the discrepancy, the institute said many businesses were simply grouped together to bring down the count. There have also been inconsistencies in the definitions used by the market authority. To make matters worse, the number of conditional business lines tends to increase after numerous adjustments are made.

Meanwhile, authorities have been slow in removing businesses that were cleared from the list by the central Government. Old decrees were still in effect, hindering the implementation of more recent laws and regulations. All of the above-mentioned issues have been counter-productive to the Government's efforts to create a more favourable business environment and support business development, according to the institute.

Nguyễn Minh Thảo, head of CIEM's Department of Business Environment and Competitiveness said the market authority has been unable to effectively reduce the number of conditional business lines or provide meaningful support to the business community. Meanwhile, fresh efforts to introduce additional administrative reforms seemed to have lost momentum in recent years.

Thảo said failure and delay in delivering real reforms could restrict development, and increase risk and costs for businesses.

According to CIEM's report, major issues with current regulations included unclear definitions of conditions businesses must meet to operate in certain industries, conditions that require paper permits, conditions that overlap with technical standards and conditions that are obsolete.

For example, under the recently implemented Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) producers could look at trillions of added expenses. While producers are fully supportive of EPR and the social and environmental benefits it entails, there have been questions regarding how the contributed funds will be managed and utilised, said Nguyễn Hồng Uy from EuroCham Vietnam.

Uy said since EPR came into effect on January 1 this year, businesses have been reporting issues related to the implementation of EPR as ministries and Government agencies were giving them insufficient guidelines.

""Businesses have been waiting for official guidelines to follow, which so far have not been made available to them,"" he said.

Uy stressed the importance of building national, unified and detailed guidelines for both the central and local governments on implementing EPR within the country.

Bạch Quốc Thắng, a representative from an association of veterinary pharmaceutical businesses said excessive red tape has been hindering the industry and putting farmers and their livestock at risk unnecessarily.

""There is no need to set up a technical condition for veterinary pharmaceutical products as they have been subjected to the same vetting procedures under the Good manufacturing practice (GMP) protocols, for example,"" Thắng said.

""The extra red tape does nothing to improve the safety of the products and goes in the opposite direction of the central Government's efforts to cut down on administrative procedures.""

The association has voiced their support for the immediate suspension of conditions imposed on pharmaceutical products, requesting them to be included and governed under the country's Laws on veterinary pharmaceuticals as a long-term solution.

Banks raise savings rates to attract depositors

Many banks have adjusted up savings interest rates by 0.2-0.3 percentage point per year since early this months to lure depositors in the context that the savings amount at the banking system has declined for the first time after 25 consecutive month increase.

Specifically, Techcombank has increased deposit interest rates at all terms. According to Techcombank's new interest rate list, depositors with a term of one to two months will receive an interest rate of 2.55 per cent per year, up 0.3 percentage point per year compared to last month.

Similarly, the bank's deposit interest rate for terms from three to five months also increased to 2.95 per cent per year, up 0.4 percentage point per year.

The rates for longer term deposits of six to 11 months and 12 to 36 months at Techcombank have also increased by 0.3 and 0.1 percentage point per year to 3.85 per cent and 4.65 per cent per year, respectively.

For deposits worth more than VNĐ1 billion, Techcombank applies a higher interest rate of 0.1-0.2 percentage point compared to the above levels, depending on each term and deposit amount.

Similarly at VIB, deposit interest rates for terms from two to five months have raised by 0.2 percentage point per year to range from 2.8 to 3 per cent per year. The bank's interest rates for 6-11 month deposits have also increased by 0.1 percentage point per year to 4.1 per cent per year.

Not only Techcombank and VIB, Bac A Bank is also in the same trend with a rate hike of 0.15-0.25 percentage point per year for six to 18 month deposits. Currently, Bac A Bank applies interest rate of 4.5 per cent per year for six-month deposits, 4.6 per cent per year for nine-month deposits, 5.1 per cent per year for 12-month deposits and 5.5 per cent per year for 18-month deposits.

Previously, a number of other banks participated in the race to increase deposit interest rates such as BIDV, VietinBank, BVBank, TPBank and Sacombank.

The deposit interest rate hike is not beyond the forecast of experts, especially in the context that the savings amount at the banking system have declined for the first time after 25 consecutive month increase.

According to the latest data from the State Bank of Vietnam, by the end of January 2024, deposits of individual customers reached nearly VNĐ6.5 quadrillion, down 0.53 per cent compared to the end of last year, while deposits of corporate customers were also declined by 2.41 per cent to more than VNĐ6.67 quadrillion.

Data from the General Statistics Office also shows that bank deposits as of March 25 this year decreased by 0.76 per cent compared to the beginning of the year, while it increased by nearly 1.2 per cent at the same period last year.

Dr. Nguyễn Đức Độ, Deputy Director of the Academy of Finance's Institute of Financial Economics, said the increase in deposit interest rates may come from the recovery of credit demand. The SBV allocated all credit quota for commercial banks right from the beginning of the year, instead of only a part as previous years, so banks must raise more deposits to readily meet the capital needs of business, production and consumption.

However, experts believe that deposit interest rates in the coming time will hardly increase sharply because the Government and SBV's orientation is to stabilise interest rates and even strive to reduce the rates to support the economic growth.

Exhibition showcases ceramics, lacquer, and gold card industry products in Hà Nội

The 2024 thematic exhibition highlighting the ceramics, lacquer and gold card industry opened on Monday.

The exhibition, featuring handicraft products, OCOP (One Commune One Product) items, and rural industry specialties, is being held at the Capital OCOP product display centre at 176 Quang Trung, Hà Đông District.

This event marks the first in a series of thematic exhibitions showcasing exquisite handicrafts, technological advancements, OCOP products, and rural industry specialties at the ""Capital OCOP product display, introduction, and promotion site"".

Aquatic exports rebound in April

Key Vietnamese aquatic exports such as shrimp and Tra fish (pangasius) saw robust growth in April, according to the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP).

Statistics indicate that the country raked in US$285 million from exporting shrimp in April, reaching the highest level since the beginning of the year.

During the four-month period, the shrimp industry grossed US$971 million, up 6% against the same period from last year.

Insiders assessed that shrimp exports showed signs of recovery as importers' inventories decreased, thereby leading to a rise in import demand.

Meanwhile, pangasius exports to major markets in April also witnessed an upturn of 13% to US$168 million after experiencing a continuous decline in both February and March.

Along with key items such as frozen pangasius fillets, local businesses tended to increase the introduction of deeply processed pangasius and value-added products.

From January to April, pangasius exports edged up by nearly 2% to reach US$579 million compared to the same period from last year.

Elsewhere, tuna exports in April surged by 28% to over US$86 million, raising the total export value during the four-month period to US$301 million, up 22% on-year.

Most notably, crab exports in April maintained an impressive growth rate of 101%, with China being the nation's leading export market.

According to experts, along with live crabs, there is plenty of room ahead for Vietnamese products such as live lobsters and sea cucumbers in the Chinese market due to its favourable geographical location and competitive advantages compared to frozen items.

Among the top five largest consumers of Vietnamese aquatic products, only seafood exports to Japan and the Republic of Korea increased slightly in April, while exports to the EU and United States experienced a downward trajectory. Indeed, exports to China - Hong Kong dropped by over 22%.

Insiders attributed this decline to high inflation and inventories in importing countries. VASEP experts expect that inventories and oversupply sources will gradually decrease and are expected to facilitate seafood exporters' activities in the second half of the year, thereby opening up a wealth of export opportunities for the seafood industry.

Enterprises continue to gain export growth momentum

The export market is showing numerous positive signs of growth, with increasing consumer demand helping Vietnamese businesses to confidently make a breakthrough in exports in the time ahead.

The export market is seeing gradual recovery thanks to reduced inventories coupled with increasing consumer demand, factors which are expected to be the foundation for Vietnamese export businesses looking to make breakthroughs.

Nguyen Dinh Tung, general director of T&T Vina Company, said that the company has just successfully signed many major and long-term orders.

Accordingly, each week the firm will export two containers of fresh coconuts to the Dubai market, along with one container of seedless lemons and dragon fruit to the Omani market.

When the general market becomes more difficult, the demand for fruits and vegetables increases. Fruit and vegetable export turnover during the four-month period indicates positive signs, especially durian exports to China; or grapefruit exports to New Zealand, Australia, and the United States, Tung added.

Gradually coming out of a period of difficulties due to a lack of orders from the end of 2022 to the end of 2023, since the beginning of the year garment and textile export orders have grown again.

Pham Van Viet, chairman of Viet Thang Jean Company, said that since early this year export orders at this enterprise have recovered and grown well compared to the same period from last year.

According to Viet, not only Viet Thang Jean, apparel businesses are also witnessing a boost in export orders thanks to market recovery, while buyers' inventories are below the minimum level, thereby making them start importing goods again. As a result, purchasing power in the traditional markets of Vietnam's textile and garment industry have recorded strong growth.

Regarding the wood industry, Dien Quang Hiep, general director of Minh Phat 2 Company, acknowledged that major markets such as the US and Europe are showing many positive signs as consumer demand for goods is gradually increasing again.

This thereby serves to promote an increase in export orders, including wood and wood products.

During the past fourth month, the export activities of the wood industry has recorded a positive growth rate of about 65% to 70% compared to 2022. With the current growth momentum, the wood industry is forecast to see many good prospects ahead this year.

However, Hiep also noted that the main export markets of the wood industry increasingly require strict control of wood origins to ensure legality, without affecting degradation, deforestation, green production, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Along with that, the increasing risk of trade fraud and falsification of product origin is also a significant challenge facing wooden furniture exporters.

With regards to the wood industry developing sustainably, in addition to meeting regulations and standards on origin and the environment, businesses must focus on investing in design, creativity, and enhancing the added value of their products.

""Businesses need to invest in new technology and digital transformation to develop new products and services, improve competitiveness, and increase efficiency and higher productivity,"" Hiep emphazized.

Counterfeit goods worryingly widespread online

Many businesses are suffering higher overhead costs because they have to increase product quality along with fighting against fake goods widely available on the Internet.

Wishing to buy a new perfume bottle, N.P.K. from Tan Phu District of HCMC found a livestream session to sell cosmetics at a discount of 50 - 70 percent in celebration the Reunification Day. Seeing that the prices of renowned perfume brand names like Chanel or Gucci are only one-fourth or one-fifth of the normal ones displayed in official outlets, she decided to purchase a Gucci bottle, paying VND600,000 (US$23.6). When receiving the pack with no formal receipt or related document and recognizing strange smells from the bottle, plus having red skin after use, she had to throw it away.

A similar story comes from V.T.V. from District 3 in HCMC. He bought a sunscreen bottle as a gift for his girlfriend after being advertised that the product was made in Japan but sold at half price as grey goods. The girl reported that the product is of low quality and might be a counterfeit as some details are different from authentic ones.

Not just luxurious goods but normal commodities like local specialty food items are being faked. In a recent livestream session, fruits and specialties of Can Gio District in HCMC received a lot of positive comments and were hot-sellers. Not long after that, some were faked, greatly annoying consumers due to mistaken purchases just because of cheaper prices.

A market management official in HCMC shared that counterfeit goods are now available everywhere. Functional agencies have already discovered warehouses after warehouses full of fake goods at different values. Most have nearly identical packages with authentic merchandise. This has annoyingly confused owners of renowned brand names in the world when they have to learn ways to differentiate between their own goods and the fake ones on the market!

A majority of counterfeit items are distributed in suburban or rural areas, where people merely know a bit about famous brand names and are willing to choose those with cheaper prices without careful checking.

Meanwhile, businesses have to spend billions of VND for the fight against these harmful products but dare not announce this publicly for fear of consumers stay away from authentic ones as well because of confidence loss. Being so lonely in this fight, they still have no better options than continuing till the end.

Huynh Van Thanh, Director of Can Gio Tuong Lai Cooperative stressed that there must be stricter sanctions to punish people who make or sell counterfeit products, while relevant state departments and localities should help businesses to formally advertise their merchandise to consumers.

Deputy Director Nguyen Quang Huy of the HCMC Market Management Department said that the spreading of counterfeit goods has become increasingly serious. Products could be faked regardless of their values or manufacturing techniques. More seriously, these items are boldly sold on trading floors, social network sites without control. Sadly, there is much trouble pinpointing and then handling them due to foxy methods of sellers. It is harder since most of these harmful products are delivered via a third party shipping company.

Aware of this, the market management team of HCMC has closely cooperated with functional agencies to support businesses sited in the city in the harsh fight against counterfeit goods. They propagandize negative effects of fake merchandise and ways to differentiate them from authentic ones to ensure the rights of both manufacturers and consumers. The professional skills of functional agencies are frequently updated to effectively handle violations regarding this matter.

Chairwoman Phan Thi Viet Thu of the HCMC Consumer Rights Protection Association said that trading counterfeit goods is extremely profitable, especially doing it online, which is why this has become so infamous now with various cunning methods.

She insisted on the necessity of close collaboration among functional agencies in checking and handling such cases. She added that businesses themselves should cooperate via their own announcements on counterfeit goods and ways to identify those unsafe products or to reach authentic ones.

Online trading is obviously lucrative yet possesses a lot of risks. There can be goods of different values, qualities, and origins available on the Internet. Meanwhile, the law enforcement force is not sufficient to cover every corner of the market. Therefore, consumers should be wise and careful to protect themselves against counterfeit goods by only buying at trusted shops that can display valid documents about the products. Under no circumstances should people choose fake items.

From December 15, 2023 to April 14, 2024, the market management force in Vietnam was able to detect and handle more than 15,500 cases of trading counterfeit goods, imposing different fines with a total value of VND171 billion ($6.72 million). This is a rise of 25 percent compared to this time last year. The confiscated goods are worth VND73 billion ($2.87 million) and the destroyed ones VND117 billion ($4.6 million).

Land-related procedures remain daunting for business - VCCI

The latest Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI) report, released by the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce (VCCI) on May 9, underscores ongoing land-related challenges faced by business and calls for local governments to deal with them in earnest.

According to the 2023 report, the ease of access to land or expanding business premises has declined. While 55.2% reported no difficulties in 2021, this percentage fell to 48% in 2022 and further to 40.7% in 2023.

The survey also highlighted that nearly 73% of businesses postponed or cancelled their expansion plans in 2023 due to cumbersome land-related administrative procedures. This figure represents an increase from 42.9% in 2022 and 53.9% in 2021.

The dynamism index of local governments appears to be less optimistic, with a decrease from 86% in 2022 to 82.1% in 2023.

About 77% of respondents still recognize the provincial efforts in being proactive and creative in addressing emerging issues, although this is a slight decline from 79.7% in the previous year.

In the 2023 PCI rankings, Quang Ninh Province maintained its lead with 71.25 points, climbing eight points from the previous year. Long An Province came second with 70.94 points, overtaking Bac Giang Province. Meanwhile, major urban centers such as HCMC and Hanoi were ranked 27th and 28th, respectively.

MWG dissolves two subsidiaries

Mobile World Investment Corporation, whose MWG shares are traded on the southern exchange, has announced to dissolve its two subsidiaries as part of its restructuring plan.

Those two subsidiaries are 4KFarm JSC and Fully Trusted Logistics JSC.

Established in November 2021, Fully Trusted Logistics JSC primarily operates in the field of road transportation, as well as provides warehousing services and supplies goods to MWG's retail chains.

4KFarm was launched in Ba Ria-Vung Tau in 2020 by MWG as a high-tech farming model based on four principles: no pesticides, no genetically modified organisms, no growth hormones, and no preservatives.

The dissolution of these two subsidiary companies is part of the restructuring plan mentioned by Nguyen Duc Tai, board chairman of Mobile World, at the recent annual shareholders' meeting.

After dissolving these two enterprises, the company now has nine subsidiary companies.

More local firms keen on trade with UAE

Since the Dubai Chamber of Commerce was set up in HCMC last year, Vietnamese businesses have been expanding trade with the United Arab Emirates.

In 2023, the non-petroleum bilateral trade between Vietnam and the UAE grew by 12.2% to US$8.6 billion. The expanding trade relationship is further evidenced by the rise in Vietnamese businesses registered with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry from 14 in 2014 to 147 as of March 2024.

Vietnam has identified several sectors with high export potential to Dubai, including furniture, seeds, tropical fruits, and coffee, aligning with Dubai's investment interest in Vietnam, especially in sustainable agriculture, construction, tourism, and food.

European production of electric vehicle batteries would dramatically slash carbon emissions compared to manufacturing in China, but the market is set to be remain reliant on Far East imports, according to a new report.

Onshoring the EV supply chain to Europe would cut the emissions of making a battery by 37 per cent compared to a China-controlled supply chain - and as much as 60 per cent when using renewable electricity, says green think tank Transport & Environment.

However, it warns that less than half of EV battery production planned for Europe by 2030 is secure, meaning manufacturers will continue to source parts built primarily in Asia.

A new report claims that European-made EV batteries would dramatically slash carbon emissions compared to China and the Far East. Pictured: inside the VinFast battery factory in Haiphong, Vietnam

By producing Europe's demand for battery cells and components locally would save an estimated 133 metric tonnes of CO2 between 2024 and 2030.

The campaign group said this saving would be equivalent to the total annual emissions of the Czech Republic today.

However, a lack of commitment to the EV transition is said to be extending the period in which car makers are reliant of sourcing components from the Asian market.

That's because only 47 per cent of the lithium-ion battery production plants planned for Europe up to 2030 are secure.

While this is an improvement on a year ago - when it was closer to a third - the remaining 53 per cent of announced cell manufacturing capacity is still at medium or high risk of being delayed, scaled down or cancelled without stronger government action.

Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility supply chains at T&E, said: 'Batteries, and metals that go into them, are the new oil. European leaders will need laser sharp focus and joined-up thinking to reap their climate and industrial benefits.

'Strong sustainability requirements, such as the upcoming battery carbon footprint rules, can reward local clean manufacturing. Crucially, Europe needs better instruments under the European Investment Bank and EU Battery Fund to support gigafactory investments.'

France, Germany and Hungary have made the most progress in securing gigafactory capacity.

In France, ACC started production in Pas-de-Calais last year while plants by Verkor in Dunkirk and Northvolt in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, are going ahead thanks to generous government subsidies.

The UK is among other European nations including Finland, Norway and Spain where most production capacity at medium or high risk due to question marks over projects.

This is due to the ongoing uncertainty around the West Midlands Gigafactory, despite huge £1billion investment from Nissan and battery partner EV Envision AESC for the construction of two plants close to the Sunderland car factory.

Tata, owners of Jaguar Land Rover, last year also confirmed it will build a huge £4billion electric car battery site in Somerset with financial backing from the Government.

Many European car makers source batteries from overseas markets, notably China, as they await the completion of a number of battery 'gigafactories' on the continent. This includes the £1bn EnvisionAESC-Nissan battery plant in Sunderland (pictured) set to open in 2025

A model of the proposed new electric battery factory JLR's owner, Tata, has confirmed in Somerset. It will cost a massive £4bn and be on stream by 2026, the company says

The report went on to warn that securing other parts of the battery value chain will be even more challenging given China's dominance and the EU's 'nascent expertise'.

For instance, Europe currently only has the potential to manufacture 56 per cent of its demand for cathodes - the battery's most valuable components - by 2030, but only two plants have started commercial operations so far.

By the end of this decade, the region could also fulfil all of its processed lithium needs and secure between 8 and 27 per cent of battery minerals from recycling in Europe.

But T&E said processing and recycling plants need EU and state support to scale quickly.

'While some battery investments that were at risk of being lured away by US subsidies have been saved since last year, close to half of planned production is still up for grabs.'

She went on to add that the European Union's decision last year to allow the sales of combustion engine to continue after 2035 provided they use climate-neutral 'e-fuels' has added uncertainty and says it is fundamental to have clarity on petrol and diesel phase-out to 'set corporate EV targets to assure gigafactory investors that they will have a guaranteed market for their product'.

A decade ago, the Czech Republic identified expansion of its nuclear fleet as the main plank in its energy future. However, it has persistently stumbled when seeking to step towards its atomic future - until now, it seems.

On April 30, France's EDF and South Korea's KHNP submitted binding bids to build a new reactor at the ageing Dukovany power plant, as well as up to three more large units.

The offers in the tender, which if fulfilled in full would constitute by far the largest ever investment in this country of 10 million people, would see two new reactors built at Dukovany and another pair at Czechia's second nuclear plant, Temelin.

Welcoming the completion of the initial phase of the tender, officials from state-controlled energy giant CEZ, which owns and operates the country's nuclear assets, suggested an accelerated process will follow to evaluate the offers by July.

""The effort is to do it well, but in such a way that the government can make a decision at once and in the middle of the year,"" said Petr Zavodsky, chairman of CEZ's nuclear construction division.

This need for speed is likely born of the long-delayed effort to expand the nuclear fleet. The project has been doing the rounds for so many years that numerous suitors have fallen by the wayside.

Russia's state nuclear holding company Rosatom was the frontrunner to win an initial tender issued by Prague in 2014 to build a reactor at Temelin. However, that race was soon scrapped because no one could decide how to pay for it.

Then three years ago, the Czech government passed legislation blocking Russia from any involvement in major infrastructure projects due to national security concerns.

Chinese officials, deployed in Prague over the years to push Beijing's nuclear and telecommunications credentials, were also sent on their way with similar words ringing in their ears.

Washington hung on for a little longer, but the US-based Westinghouse, previously hot favourite for the current tender, fell out of the running in January, with Czech officials saying its initial offer had not met the conditions.

This left CEZ with just the two offers to review before it makes its recommendation to the government, which has said it hopes to sign a contract with the winning bidder by April 2025, and to see the first unit go into operation by 2038.

Martin Jirusek from Brno's Masaryk University, who specialises in energy geopolitics, calls the filing of the binding bids ""a major step towards finally building a new unit at Dukovany"".

Czechia's six operating nuclear reactors, which have a capacity of around 4,000 megawatts (MW), generate around 35 per cent of the country's electricity, but that should rise above 50 per cent under the government's long-term energy strategy.

The importance of implementing that strategy has only grown since it first emerged in 2015. Originally prompted by the upcoming closure of ageing conventional power plants as well as the decommissioning of Dukovany's four 500 MW reactors from 2035, rising environmental and energy security concerns have since added to the urgency.

Prague remains unenthusiastic about further developing renewable energy sources, and has increasingly pushed to be allowed to put nuclear at the forefront of its transition efforts as EU climate targets have tightened over recent years.

Meanwhile, the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including the energy crunch and cost-of-living crisis, has put energy security front and centre of government policy, especially for those countries towards the eastern edge of the EU which were so heavily dependent on Russian oil and gas before 2022.

""This is a strategic investment which is absolutely essential,"" Prime Minister Petr Fiala said earlier this year. ""Nuclear power will ensure enough electricity at reasonable prices and it will enable the country to meet international climate goals. It is the only way forward.""

Perhaps not coincidently, on the same day as the filing of the final tender bids the European Commission announced that it had approved the Czech government's financing plan for the construction of the first new reactor at Dukovany.

The reason for the long delay in the effort to build new nuclear units can ultimately be found in the tension between CEZ's commercial interests and the state's energy security priorities.

The energy giant's private shareholders, who hold almost 14 per cent of the company, have fought hard against plunging into the pricey and risky endeavour of investing in new nuclear power. It is widely accepted that a new reactor at Dukovany will cost much more than the original estimate of 160 billion koruna (6 billion euros).

The state has, meanwhile, been seeking a route to take on the costs itself that would not be blocked by EU rules.

Similar to the effect it had on the Czech government's drive, the standoff with Russia also appears to have helped soften Brussels' concerns regarding nuclear, alongside lobbying efforts by a group of EU member states, mostly from the east but with France in the vanguard.

After an extended debate, the EU handed nuclear power a classification as a sustainable investment in late 2022, opening the way for eased investment conditions and the green light just given to Prague.

""It's a new era,"" Jirusek declares. ""Prague's crossing of this hurdle illustrates that the EU now recognises that building new nuclear is impossible in Europe without state aid.""

The plan to supply a state loan and a contract for difference (CfD) to the Dukovany project, which will guarantee CEZ a certain price for the electricity produced, was submitted to Brussels two years ago.

The approved state aid package should be enough to allow CEZ to finally go ahead, analysts suggest, but only with the original project to build a single unit at Dukovany.

""Since the terms of the tender have changed and more than one unit is subject to the tender, the government will have to ask for approval of the model of the construction financing again,"" note analysts at J&T Bank.

This uncertainty over the funding of the remaining units that Prague hopes to build appears to offer the French bidder an advantage, and EDF is now widely assumed to be the frontrunner.

As an EU heavyweight, Paris was vital to the successful push against German and Austrian objections to persuade Brussels to accept nuclear as a contributor to the energy transition.

That fight is unlikely to fade away, with Czechia's neighbours remaining strongly opposed to nuclear power.

Prague's continued need for French backing in Brussels is a point that President Emmanuel Macron doubtless reminded Fiala as he has pushed EDF's case with the Czech government.

Yet even with the heft of Paris onside, Prague faces numerous uncertainties regarding its ambition to build a whole new nuclear fleet.

On the one hand, there's no guarantee that the EU's openness to nuclear technology will continue indefinitely.

Jirusek suspects that ""the green light of the funding for the first unit at Dukovany doesn't necessarily suggest that state aid approval for other projects will be forthcoming.""

And even if it does, the fervour of Fiala's government to balance the state's wobbly finances could temper its nuclear enthusiasm or even the ability to fund the trillions of koruna that it would likely take to build all four units.

Fiala's response to the cost-of-living crisis was to launch a tough austerity programme that has provoked widespread anger, especially among the most vulnerable sections of society. That has led to a collapse in support for the five-party coalition, which now trails the centrist and far-right populist opposition by some margin.

CEZ's minority shareholders could also resist a bigger roll out of the nuclear strategy that would inevitably suck up so much financial and management resources.

Not long ago, Fiala was touting a plan to force out these minority shareholders by introducing legislation that would allow the government to split the company. The scheme was dropped after it became clear that it would be unconstitutional, leaving the tension between CEZ's profit motives and the state's national interests simmering.

Daniel Benes, CEO of CEZ, has previously warned that the funding model just approved for the first reactor can't simply be replicated for further units, but that the company will need increased state support if it is required to sink more capital into the strategy.

Technological questions will also crop up as the nuclear strategy unfolds over the coming decades.

Czechia lags its EU peers in the development of renewable energy, but a serious build-up is thought to be on the way. The development of solar power capacity has accelerated significantly over the past couple of years after lying dormant for a decade or more. And the country's wind power potential is also being reassessed.

However, any renewables momentum wouldn't detract from nuclear, which is still viewed by analysts as the backbone of the energy system to complement more intermittent renewable energy supply. But it will require financing and focus from CEZ.

At the same time, the state and the company also plan to start building still-in-development small modular reactors (SMRs). Should the concept, based on units of around 300 MW, prove viable, it could pose questions over the plans for large reactors, which are costlier, more complex and slower to build.

Another challenge is the necessity of building a nuclear fuel dump.

EU regulations now insist that a deep radioactive waste repository (DWR) must be built by 2050 in order for new nuclear energy projects to qualify as sustainable investments.

Prague has been working on this gargantuan task, which comes riddled with social and political pitfalls, for over two decades with barely any progress to show for it.

In contrast to the plan to build new nuclear units, the construction of a DWR is much more contentious among the Czech public, with survey's suggesting three-quarters of people think they should be allowed to reject any such facility in their municipality.

According to CEZ, public support for nuclear power sits above 70 per cent, ""which is uniquely high in Europe"".

This suggests that despite all the difficulties, there's little political risk hanging over the nuclear programme. Every one of the seven political parties that sit in parliament support building more reactors.

The reasons behind this remarkable level of support have long been pondered. A strong industrial lobby, decades of centralised power, and various scandals over renewables subsidies are all mooted.

The more cynical suggest that the huge funds new nuclear projects send washing through the system are a major driving force.

Either way, the filing of the binding bids and EU state aid approval suggest that Czechia is likely to finally start realising its nuclear dreams.

""It seems likely now that the first unit will be built. It will replace the two older units at Dukovany, and avert the risk of needing to decommission that site,"" says Jirusek.

However, there are already doubts over how long the dream may last.""Beyond that first unit, it's very hard to tell,"" the analyst continues. ""It's far-fetched to imagine for now that the others will all go ahead. There are so many moving parts that would need to fall into place.""",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,Balkan Insight,0.192156862745098,453341711,7,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/c-52.png,

Romantsova","What is the state of human rights regarding the aggression by Russia against Ukraine in early 2024?

*Further original, internal sources are at the bottom of the article.*

*Interview conducted April 16, 2024.*

Ms. Oleksandra Romantsova is the Executive Director (2018-present) of the Center for Civil Liberties in Ukraine, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 under her and others' leadership in documenting war crimes. This will be a live series on human rights from a leading expert in an active context from Kyiv, Ukraine. Here, we talk about updates from February 5 to April 16.

Scott Douglas Jacobsen: Okay, so today, we are here for our fourth interview with Oleksandra Romantsova of the Center for Civil Liberties in Kyiv, Ukraine. We have been covering the human rights aspects or facets of the Russo-Ukrainian war based on Russian aggression into Ukraine starting, in terms of a full-scale invasion, on February 24, 2022. I am based out of nearby Montreal, Quebec, Canada, so the time zones are more helpful this time than from Vancouver. Our last interview was February 5. So, we will start with the reportage from that time and continue forward from there. I will begin with a general sense. What have been some of the changes in tactics and some of the newer human rights trends you have noticed in the Spring of 2024 so far?

Oleksandra Romantsova: First of all, that was the opening of the second warrant of the chief of the army of the Russian Federation about shelling the civilian system. One of them made some little breaks, which was interesting. When you have this break, nobody attacks you via rockets. You are thinking about when they start to do that. It started months before. Now, it is the middle of April. That was the middle of March. They started shelling every day, during the day. It can be 50 rockets, some drones, or something like that. If something happened in Kyiv, then this means something happened in Dnipro, Zapirozhzhia, Mykolaiv, and other places. So, the main change is that they attack concrete electricity systems. They stopped doing that. We waited in the Winter because it is usually more painful without electricity, but they started in the Spring. Before that, Ukraine was a big country that produced much electricity. We sell it. We have many rivers with the stations. They try to destroy bigger stations. Which is called Dnipro station [Ed. Dinpro hydroelectric dam], these systems are regularly attacked now.], It was built during the Soviet Union. Before, there was an explosion by Hitler's army. So, for image, it is a wrong decision for the Russian military to try and destroy it. They supply a few rockets to them. However, it still works now. They have some images, but not crucial. They are trying to stop Ukraine, try not to allow us to have businesses, economics - any processes. Things people can need or want: leave Ukraine, etc. I do not know the main idea behind this targeting. People will speak about fighting. The more problems we have, the less support we have from the US, and the fewer shells we have. If they figure out the channels and what they are trying to do, they will put much effort into propaganda in the United States. They want to show it is not an important question - Ukraine - and Israel is more important. The US is totally in the process of election now. They are not so quick to make this decision. This means we are prepared to fight but do not have enough arms. That is a big problem. It is a big problem for us because it means that every day, people die there on the frontline. People are dying here because we do not have enough shells. We do not have enough shells to destroy their rockets, which they send to our cities. We know that. We have the skills, but we do not have the tools to implement what we know. It is the situation. This means that things have changed a lot inside Ukraine. It is primarily a reaction to that.

Jacobsen: What about the European Union providing finance, shells, and fighter jets?

Romantsova: The European Union decided to support us, meaning they will start producing more shells and can help us after a year. We must survive this year without enough shells, so that is the problem.

Jacobsen: With regards to the gridlock happening in a lot of American political cycles, is it more or less accurate when Zelensky states that if the United States does not support Ukraine with more resources, the Russian Federation is likely to take much Ukrainian territory if not win the war against Ukraine? [Ed. The new bill was passed on April 20, 2024, to support Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. Likewise, The Associated Press reported on ways military aid can be expedited. The expectation is a giant spring of aggression by the Russian Federation forces. NATO and others look to air defences for Ukraine. Kremlin claims America is repeating Vietnam-like humiliation, and more deaths will follow the aid package.]

Romantsova: Good question. The biggest problem is that people forget about the situation. The situation can get worse, not better. It is not a good position for politicians. People think of the Ukrainian war as a usual thing. Some politicians state this as a typical war, a usual thing. They say, ""Ukrainians will fight. It will be long. So, Ukrainians can do that alone."" However, we cannot... we can be finished. All of us who stay here will fight. All who do not will not prepare to continue to fight. They will start just going to other countries. It creates a crisis. Even certain millions of people are not easy for Europe; this makes them less and less comfortable. Is it possible Ukraine will fall? Yes, it is possible. It means all of us will be dead. It is impossible to have a miracle. Something is blowing up in the political system of the Russian Federation. If it happens, all of us will be surprised. It is not exactly what you can plan. You can say, ""Everyone, we planned that. We account for that or something like that."" No, we have one chance. It will be fought until the Russian Federation breaks down at the economic or political level, but it will not take one month. It takes years. That is why, for us, it is essential to remember the USA. It is not a question that some Ukrainians ask more than others. It is a question: If Ukraine will lose, it will be a problem for all of Europe. Some countries like Hungary or Slovenia have started collaborating with Russia. It is not so big, the castle. It can be the point of turn that can be a game changer. Although this situation is game-changing, it can be like this now. That is why we speak with Americans; even Europe will start to support us with the same money. However, you cannot shoot with cash. It would help if you hit with guns. So, we need guns. Most of the guns that we need are in America. As you know, the Canadian army cannot help.

Jacobsen: No, they have been in a tough spot now. They have also been shrinking for a while, even within an infusion of over $70 billion over several years [Ed. Two decades.]. The Canadian army is in a tough spot ethically and politically. Even though Canadian citizens who are not serving members will give contradictory or seemingly conflicting responses in surveys, on the one hand, Canadians will want Canadian forces to be more active in international affairs. Still, most do not want to serve in the first place. Fundamentally, they want to help other nations with their problems, but they do not want to be the ones troubled with helping those problems. There are violations of the rights of men and women in service. Internationally, in terms of NATO commitments, because we were well below even the minimum standard of relative GDP contribution (2%) to the Canadian Armed Forces, we may send 1,500 service members to Latvia; however, in general, we are pretty limited in our contributions internationally, except, maybe, in training, where we might train Ukrainian captains in French. Also, we have ancient equipment across the board, from rifles to submarines. So, on the Canadian side, I would not expect significant contributions from the Canadian Armed Forces for some time.

Romantsova: Canada has provided good financial support. However, that is the problem. You cannot eat money. You cannot shoot money. You need money transformed into something. Most of the support for our budget is limited only to social needs. So, that means that is why Russia attacks concrete suppliers, power plants, etc. Because we need 40% of our budget, which is produced by our economy, in steel, only this 40% can be used for arms, guns, and supporting the army. All other support from outside of Ukraine has conditions. We can use it only for salaries and pensions. Stuff like this. That is why it is so important to get support from the USA; support from the USA was for arms. That is the difference.

Jacobsen: One political commentator in the United States commented on the effect of weakening an enemy or rival nation with violent intent while also supporting a country in need and a more robust and muscular ally, which is a win-win situation. Also, the creation of those arms strengthens the American economy. It would be a positive in general for the American State. Now, about the human rights conditions of citizens, the newer actions or the stronger push has been toward the targeting of critical infrastructure in Ukraine by Russian Federation forces. People probably will not see this video, but the lights are off in your place. They are not off in mine. Even in Kyiv, they are targeting electrical grids and stations. How is this change to try to terrorize the public even more, impacting the trends of fighting and then the morale of the public at large?

Romantsova: It is a good question. During this time, we have one month of changes to legislation for recruitment and mobilization to the army. Many people do not like these changes. A lot of these people do not like these changes. What other decision can be made? No, you are not like this. What do you propose as a way to do this? So, but still, as for me, it is understandable. All of us, my team, and I, have the opportunity to work only because people from frontlines support us. They help us because they defend us. We are here because it is not our turn to go to the frontline. Maybe it happened. Perhaps it happened that even such a person who does not have any war specialization or something needs to go to the frontline. It is possible. As for me, it is still a big question. How does the army need to be organized? What kind of solution? What kind of weapons? What type of ammunition do people need? Because we will always have fewer people than Russia because Russia is four times bigger by population and four times less attractive to save someone. So, they do not care. They may care about some generals or professionals but do not care about soldiers. So, they can send thousands of them to kill a few Ukrainians because for them... we see this the last ten years. They do not care even about their population. It is a big problem. We call this an asymmetric answer. So, if they have many soldiers, we must have a lot of technology, such as drones. A lot of this is not about human rights. It is tough to speak about human rights when you have such a situation with war and your situation of security. So, from our side, we have not changed from the other side.

People still give their donations and lots of donations. Ukrainians collect the money and send it to volunteers for the technology, which they believe supports our citizens on the front lines. Drones, for example, or 'a system of audio fighting,' may be translated like this. It protects soldiers from drones from the Russian side. It still happens through NGOs. Minister of Defense they have their process. However, they are still working through NGOs, just through NGOs.

Jacobsen: How is the public morale in Ukraine now? Does it vary by city, or is there a general high or a general low?

Romantsova: All of us are tired and depressed. However, it does not change the situation. Yes, we are pretty not the politest and kindest people now. When people speak about an attack in Moscow, we are not celebrating, but we are not waiting or something. Israel was attacked. I have friends in Israel. However, sorry, all of this rocket and shell was destroyed before. However, nobody does that for Ukraine, and it is every day. Missiles killed people. The USA still discusses whether they need to support Ukraine or not. It is terrible competition. It can lead to more suffering from some war or not. However, it is still emotionally hurtful when people say, ""Ukraine is one country to get attacked every day."" It is injustice.

Jacobsen: Is the general idea that the Russian Federation is planning a more protracted war, given that it contributes one-third of its expenditures to the military?

Romantsova: Nobody knows what kind of plan Russia has. I think they need some victory. However, tomorrow, Putin can say to his population. ""We have a victory,"" and then stop the war. He can imagine. He can make his propaganda make any picture. We try to guess. They send more and more signals, not directly to Kyiv, but to different international parties. They want to have a negotiation. Now, they are on the negotiation side. We would be strong enough. If they stop this line and lead by their control of more than 21% of our territory and more than 6,000,000 people for them, it will look good enough for them. For us, it is destroying any opportunity to bring back these people. We do not know how many lives are changed because Russians kill every day. It is the same thing. We do not see what happens with kidnappings. First of all, it is not a question. I do not have an answer. I have the purpose to fight. I do not know what the end will be -- peace for us. If we exist, it means they bring back all of our people and are protected from Russia. It is important. Ukrainians do not like fighting. Ukrainians fight because we have no other choice but to defend ourselves. We will stop the fight if someone proposes another way to define ourselves. I think it is okay for us to look to other situations. People need to be released. It is important.

Jacobsen: In late February, President Zelensky went to Saudi Arabia to push for peace in a push for POWs in Russia. How was the POW (prisoner of war) situation with Ukraine and Russia? Has anything gone forward about exchanges?

Romantsova: They (POWs) are still there. They have one or two exchanges. That is all. It begs the question about civilians. We do not have only prisoners like combatants who are going to become prisoners of war. Also, all the prisoners of war, when they return to us, are in bad condition. They torture them. It is a good question. The status of prisoners of war is a status in international humanitarian law, which needs to protect you if you recognize the other side, e.g., prisoners of war. They need to care about you, give you food and normal conditions, not extremely hot or cold. You need to get medicine support if you need it. It would help if you had the opportunity to make contact with your family. Russia does not do anything of that, mainly through an International Committee of the Red Cross. So, you can be judged through the court because you take the duty in the army. Russia breaks even this. So, they put them in jail, some prisoners. It is like a big argument from Russia's side when trading inside negotiations. That is why they take people. They only need the people to press Ukraine down for the arguments as to why their proposition needs to be taken. Until now, many NGOs here, every day, including prisoners of war and civilian prisoners, have different communication campaigns around the world about that. Still, it is a point number for politicians in policy. It is still painful here.

Jacobsen: What about the elections in the Russian Federation with these murders, etc.?

Romantsova: It is like the election of President Putin, which wins President Putin. It is not an election. For 20 years, the Russian Federation has not had any elections. It is like Belarus. Nobody believes it is an election. Navalny is trying to push it in some way to use the mechanisms. They are trying to use different tools to create some intrigue there. However, no, it is always the election of President Putin. Now, it is illegally recognized. They include in this election occupied territory, and they make this illegal process poison. The election will be the same with Lukashenko (Belarus). Lukashenko was not recognized for the last election. Putin, as I understood, the European Union has this position. I do not hear about the consensus of West's voices that now he is illegal. However, he still leads the Russian Federation.

Jacobsen: What about the UN nuclear watchdog director going to Moscow to discuss nuclear safety in Ukraine? Was there any result from that?

Romantsova: Nuclear safety in Ukraine is one of the most significant results, not because they released the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. They think it has much more of a role than India, China, and somebody from the West to stop something terrible from happening. Macron changed his position in this way. He started answering, ""Okay, you are not alone with nuclear weapons."" It is a significant change. It is not because of Ukraine. It is because Wagner made a problem for the French army. You feel that you live on a small, connected Earth. That is the source of my optimism. We are still determining what we will indeed get from the Russian Federation. If China changes some positions, Russia will finally need to take back their army.

Jacobsen: Since joining NATO and ending its post-WWII neutrality, has Sweden made any moves to help in the Ukrainian efforts?

Romantsova: Most neutrality is an official status of some states like Switzerland, Austria, Finland, and Turkmenistan. It is funny that Turkmenistan has an official neutral status. You must have special voting, call signs, and unique documents at the UN. Switzerland is trying to take it back. Russia said they are an unfriendly country now since membership of NATO. Unless they lose it. In Europe, Austria stays in this status. Now, it is a big, big question. Maybe countries from Asia, Africa, etc., can take a spot. We are not counting this country. So, we are still looking to the West - America, Canada, maybe Germany, but we are not looking to other countries like Brazil, Argentina, or South Africa. These countries are in Africa. We are waiting, growing up, and starting a dialogue with all of these countries. They will not consistently be grown. A lot of them began to shoot during the negotiation. If African countries exist without any government but have an army and, sometimes, more arms than the Czech Republic or Poland, it is a huge question about the biggest problem that we still have. This terroristic act on the city hall near Moscow. It is part of this. They show this exactly when the Russian Federation is trying to concentrate its power and systems in Ukraine. They are open and vulnerable to other problems. Islamistic conflict between Russia and some groups, e.g., Russia supports the Taliban and ISIS. They are trying to kill them in Syria. All this continues. None of this stops because of the Ukrainian situation. I am trying to look at this round from the Ukrainian side. From the Ukrainian side, we need anything to fight and to survive. When we speak about the bigger picture, all of us need to not only look at Europe; we need to look around. It is not only Europe or a Western crisis. It is a crisis of the whole world.

Jacobsen: What about these human rights violations with regards to joining the Russian army, e.g., Indians being duped - Indian nationals, citizens - into joining the Russian Federation army and then fighting for them? They leave with an injury or something. Now, Indian authorities, at least since early March, are in early talks with Russian officers to deal with these kinds of human rights abuses of Indian nationals tricked into fighting for the Russian army based on false promises.

Romantsova: Look, Xenophobia in the Russian Federation is enormous. I do not think someone from another nation can come to the Russian army and will be enough in contact to be part of the rest. It is not possible. First, most Russians do not know other languages except Russian and rude Russian.

Jacobsen: Rude Russian?

Romantsova: It is from Fifth Element. It is trendy here. That was a phrase from the hero, Bruce Willis. 'I know only two languages. Rude words and English.' [Ed. ""Whoa, lady, I only speak two languages, English and bad English.""] Every time, they mention some nationality, such as Makhachkala. Makhachkala, they come to the airport and go to the airfield and try to take back from the plane; families, Jewish families, who were from Israel or something like this, or some other place, because it is a Muslim region.

The same situation now, when Crocus City Hall was attacked, these were guys from Turkmenistan. It is a part of the old Soviet Union, a separate country with a broad autocratic regime. Now, these people come to Russia to have a primitive... Whenever Russians have an opportunity to show their xenophobia, they do that. I cannot imagine people with dark skin, with absolutely no English, not the same English where they expect to hear from people. That is not the precise pronunciation that will be respected in the Russian Federation. I cannot even imagine. So, they will be killed, not by Russians, but sent without ammunition or something. They send, send, send people without any support. So, I do not know.

Jacobsen: On March 9, Pope Francis stated that Ukraine and its allies should, more or less, wave the white flag. Given the size of the Catholic Church worldwide, this comes from a prominent world religious leader. How was that met last month, the comment from the Pope?

Romantsova: The Pope said something. Ukrainians and their population are usually used to that.

Jacobsen: It was criticized and met on deaf ears.

Romantsova: In Ukraine, we have 72 different kinds of churches, including Jewish, old Oriental forms of Christianity like the Copts or Armenian Christian Church, Muslim, Russian, and Buddhist temples. It includes different kinds of Christianity: Baptist churches and old Russian churches. So, Greek and Catholic, it is an organized community. It is focused mainly on the western part of Ukraine. They connect it with the Pope. They first hear what the Pope will say because Ukrainians believe in the Pope of their church. All other people think, ""One more politician who says something. What can you expect?"" Most people do not make much distinction between the Pope and the president. They know it is in Italy and a separate country, blah-blah-blah. It exists, and people who work for that. My organization's head needs to meet with the Pope in the following months. The Pope, traditionally, is a figure who can make negotiations. We will be continuing to speak with them because he is still essential. He can say something.

Jacobsen: Not too long ago, Ukrainian forces lost the city of Avdiivka after several months of very, very intense fighting. What has been the social and political impact within the context of the war?

Romantsova: It is so interesting. You say a few months. A few actions cover it. Now, you cannot get the views. All of the social impacts of what happened. First of all, many soldiers commented about Avdiivka. They take it back earlier than in Bakhmut, but it takes two weeks or something like that. That is the effect on the population and its attention now. Two weeks after that, we had another problem. I am sure the family who lost someone there or soldiers who were angry for their combat that way. They organized getting out of there and taking them out of there. For them, that was different news. For the rest of the population, ""We had a terrible day on the frontline. What can we do to have a good day on the frontline?""

Jacobsen: What were the remaining presidential comments about Estonia becoming the next NATO alliance leader? Does this have worse or better political implications vis-a-vis NATO for Ukrainian support?

Romantsova: It is essential. Does the commentator take us there or not? We have some rules. They do not include new countries with a planned conflict or something like that. Every time we hear about someone, we will feel only one comment. If it is expected, will it be possible for them to take Ukraine tomorrow or not? If a specialist discusses how this person can be helpful or not for Ukraine membership, that's all.

Jacobsen: How extensively are prisoners of war being tortured by Russian forces? There are reports of Ukrainian prisoners of war being tortured in Russia. Is there an extent of how far this is going, or is it just general knowledge that there is torture being done to Ukrainian prisoners of war?

Romantsova: It has happened to all prisoners over the last ten years. When we take people back from there, they give testimonies about it. That is not just a torture. The whole scope of imagined horrors, Hollywood horrors, over the last 40 years, they use it, including sexual and gender-based violence. It is a huge, huge, massive variety of tortures. We have testimonies of people who went through that by themselves.

Jacobsen: It is reported that one-third of Russian warships in the Black Sea have been destroyed or disabled. Is this a significant win for the Ukrainian side of the war, or are more substantial wins or points of import for the Ukrainian military and Ukrainians in general more to do with air superiority and artillery now? In other words, are the Navy's victories not the sort of victories they need?

Romantsova: I cannot specifically comment on the military. Yes, I have friends. Some of my friends are on the frontline. They are mainly at the ordinary level of the army. So, I need insights or a deep understanding of it. People suffered. All of the relatives suffered. People were killed on the frontline. They are fighting. We are still not Russia. They have had enough success. That is all that I know.

Jacobsen: What about other nations that do not have outstanding human rights records supporting the war effort of the Russian Federation? Not merely Iran with drones or North Korea with missiles but significant support from the Chinese government based on intelligence reports.

Romantsova: Most countries or nations are in the Middle East or Central Asia. We do not understand all of this region, as we do not have a profound traditional relationship with them. We speak about Central Asia. It is a former Soviet Union country. That is why we have a connection, but it is not deep. Ukraine has most of its information from intelligence services, whether in diplomacy or trading. You can buy some information from commercials. For example, we buy from Sputnik and put them in space. So, when we speak about what kind of information we need for fighting and whether China, Iran, or India have some technologies to give information for fighting, do they have some support for Russia or some support for Ukraine? It is carefully secured information, where our army takes information. The British intelligence service only wants guys who regularly command something on the frontlines between Ukraine and Russia. It could have happened in other sources. However, for Ukrainian sources, we have many sources from British intelligence services -- they publicly have some commanders. So, this war depends on intelligence, not simply intelligence, but the cyber information database. The war information is only taken from cyberspace. For example, where is a power plant in Ukraine? You can try to use an old map from the Soviet Union.

In the same way, you can break this power plant's system management, which connects with primary sources in cyberspace. Cyberspace information is what you need in this conflict. Many people are involved in cyberspace fighting and cyberwarfare around our Ukrainian-Russian war. China plays a large part in that. I do not know if they will ever speak about that publicly. I do not know if they publicly support Russia, but Chinese hackers participate. I know that.

Jacobsen: The recent attack on Israel by Iran; I am mixing this because Russia uses the drones used by Iran in the Russo-Ukrainian war. There was a significant response from the Israelis and Americans. Reports are that at least 99% of those missiles and drones launched were taken down before impact. So, is there a lesson to be learned from that, given the fact that much of the long-distance being done can be done to Ukraine, whether infrastructure, residential areas, or military targets have to do with missiles and drones?

Romantsova: First, we must understand that Israel is small. Second, I need to find out the rockets used by Iran to make this strike and launch them. As I understand it, it is an excellent example that the USA or other countries have such technology, which can help us. They cover some parts of Ukraine. They may need help to do that for an extensive territory like Ukraine. If we compare Israel and Ukraine, the size difference is significant. So, Israel will always be protected by the USA. It is true. However, we need many negotiations to have the same status to negotiate a lot.

Jacobsen: Do the primary areas for winning significant hunks against the Russian Federation involve cyber operations, cyber warfare and economic warfare? If we look at critical economic indicators within the Russian Federation, things like the society's size and growth rate in terms of people brought in through immigration or being born there. Russia has been declining for at least two decades or stagnating yearly. By 2050, the estimates are that they will lose ten million people in their total population numbers. So, it is a shrinking population, as with China in the last couple of years...

Romantsova: But you know, Russia has had a demographic crisis before. That is why I told you about xenophobia but at the same time. Russia needs labour from Central Asian countries because Central Asian countries mostly have language, former Soviet Union countries, but Baltic countries are members of the EU. Most know the Russian language but will never come to Russia to be simple workers or work simple jobs. They will go to the EU if they need money. It is the same with Belarus. I am not going to Russia, but to Poland, for example. As you understand now, Ukrainians are in the same situation as Moldova. Georgia and Armenia are location countries. Azerbaijan has more profit and income than Russia, so they are not going to Russia to have money through simple work or labour. Georgians and Armenians are small, two small countries.

All of them have a problem with Russia. So, only Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, all of those countries. Now, more and more, as big as Kazakhstan, they are much more speaking about anti-colonialism directions because they accept colonialism (former). The colonial politics of the Russian Federation, so only Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, etc., are countries with small populations. Now, no one likes them - the Russian Federation - because of Crocus City Center. That was the first season in these countries who returned to countries - these Central Asian countries - more than they left them. That means that the Russian Federation lost its labourers from Central Asia.

I think at the end of the year. They will lose even more. They are not like before, giving citizenship to the labourers in Central Asia. Most of them prefer to have citizenship of the Russian Federation, but they do not provide them. They like to use them like simple, cheap labourers, but not a part of politicians and the electorate. It is a difficult situation. Putin is trying to solve this through Ukrainian children. That is one of the reasons why they steal or kidnap them. It is the same if we speak about the Ukrainian population. One of my dreams of Putin is to join the territory of Ukraine tak, take all of this, repeal Ukrainians into the Russian population and solve the demographic crisis like this. However, one of the ways they are trying to control the matrimonial function of women. They are trying to put the women or motivate the women to have more children. One of the ideas is a bill in parliament that states that women can have higher education if they do not have two children.

Jacobsen: So, if they have higher education, they cannot.

Romantsova: It is just a bill. It is not a law now. They can, like all previous stupid bills, accept. It can be a backstep. Women in the Russian Federation, you must have two children before deciding to take higher education at university. It is against the classical, traditional Soviet Union idea that everyone should have higher education. Most of the populations of the former Soviet Union countries have higher education. In Ukraine, 80% of people have higher education. It is the usual and traditional period of your life. It does not mean you are choosing to go to university or not. You are going to university, or you - we call them - have a budget place where the State pays. Second, your parents collect the money and try to give it to you. For example, it is less expensive here in Ukraine than in the USA. It is traditional for most people here to have a higher education in some way. So, that is turning back from the evolution of the Soviet Union time.

Jacobsen: There are also statements about women having eight or more children or being urged to have eight or more children by Russian Federation leadership. At the same time, they are really pushing in the media and bills, not laws, so far, but also restricting the psychology of women's freedom through the repeal of physical protections for women. If a woman feels unsafe in the home, she will not feel safe to go out to do things freely: to get an education, to get a job, to have different and varied friends, and so on. Things like the repeal of the domestic violence protection law so that legally, you can, as a husband, beat your wife in Russia. That is a form of psychological warfare, too, not just a non-penalization of a negative behaviour. That sort of thing. It is along the lines of what you are saying as well. Only if you have children can you go and have children, where it is part, as you mentioned earlier, of what was a Soviet idea at the time of having higher education.

Romantsova: The Soviet idea was different at different times. It was 17 years. There was absolute equality between men and women initially, even in the understanding. They were trying to break the family's knowledge. It is not necessary to have a family to have some sexual relationship or to have children. However, after all the control of the State, they understood that having a family is much more comfortable for control. So, they started to speak, ""Yes, sure, women have equal rights here. In the Soviet Union, they are like men."" Society waiting, ""Yes, you have a job, but you have a 'second job.'"" At home, you take care of the children. Soviet women were with children. Women who care about the house and the deficit. It is a result of a centralized economy, a centralized planning economy. Women were mainly responsible for taking stock, finding, and buying things. Loads of people do not have the opportunity to use money, and those who do not use it. Women were responsible for home management, and they had work. They have a traditional need to have an education. All of this is built on a new glass ceiling for women. Some women are ministers in history or chiefs at big industrial companies. But mostly, you will not find these names in the history. That was not usual. That was not normal because women usually mainly cared about their families. So, education for women. That was a must-have. So, now, Russia wants to change. Russia changed the mental map of regular societal roles in the Russian Federation. They decriminalized home violence. They take back all the other areas of your life, except family, which you can control. You can't control your business, what kind of political media comes. You can't control whether you will have war or not. You can control one: Your family, if you are a man. If you are a woman, you need to find a man because all other ways to be protected will not help. So, inside the family, the man controls; it comes to a system of breeding families until the end of the 19th century when only men had a relationship with the State. Women always have any relationship with the State only through the man. Only your husband or your brother or father is responsible for your status. They determine your status. It is something like this. It is much easier to control men who only have power inside the family, so young control the family. So, the man controls the wife and children through this process. It is one of the ways they do this, as well as religion. They support spreading this Russian Orthodox ideology. But in this way, they are falling. They fall because statistics show fewer and fewer young people in the Russian Federation attend church. They may be believers but not members of the church.

Jacobsen: They are following in the line, ironically, of most of the Western world, which is a stark decline in attendance and belief in organized religion, particularly Christianity.

Romantsova: What happened with Russia is not a surprise, but a big problem for them; it is Islamization. In this situation, Islam gives more answers than Christianity.

Jacobsen: How so?

Romantsova: Islam talks about the Islamic State. Any state is foul. It needs to be corrected. It's because they need to recognize national or political management. In Muslim ideology, all the rights of believers are with one nation, Summa. All of these national countries or nations are false. It is temporary. We will all be in one Islamic world. So, it is one of the strong ideologies if you don't like a state. Putin created a state that is a system that can be unlikeable in one moment. If people do not have an average education, Islam proposes a sound system and understanding why Putin is wrong and all states are a bad idea. Allah did not create the states. So, that is all false. It is happening, first of all, in the jails. Before, in the Russian Federation, imagine 1 million people in prisons; it is a lot. Before, there were black and red jails; we call them zona. It is a secured zone, a jail. Black jails exist. The system of law calls them ""person who steals something.""

People who steal: Thieves. It was like a vast system of thieves during the Soviet era who created their law system. That's romanticized. This parallel reality exists in the jails. These are huge complexes that thieves control. They have their law, economic system, and all of this. It is not a mafia. It is a law. It is not one organization but a system of law. They call them ""thieves of the law."" Part of this reality was, again, the Soviet Union system. For example, Greek Catholic believers or a national movement against the Soviet Union. They are the same as Putin in jail. They start to be part of this system. It is fierce. They are criminals. They control part of these jails. Other parts of jails were controlled. During the Soviet Union, political cases and prisoners were put in red jails. Because police officers can prevent this, there are only two kinds of prisons now. Now, the third part of the jails is green, not black or red. Green means Islamic. This means that this is a closed society. It works by Islamic laws. It works through the law of crime. That is new. Before, it did not exist at all in the territory of former Soviet countries.

Jacobsen: It is points at interviews like this where I enjoy them because I have covered such a broad range of subject matter in a little over a decade.

Romantsova: [Laughing].

Jacobsen: Because I put in a lot of time. I have interviewed a lot of members of the ex-Muslim community. There is a whole host of them. A lot of the online secular community, especially, is one place in which they can formally organize, communicate, share arguments, share stories, help others who are getting out of more cases and help them leave religion when religion has taken an extreme form. Not as extreme as Salafi Wahhabi interpretations from Saudi Arabia, but certainly, family and community and national contexts where it is dangerous for them. So, you're talking about the thing in which they find many problems. Not they disagree with you; they agree with you because they see a threat of politicized religion in the way that a lot of people would see politicized Christianity as an issue in North America or in Russia, particularly in the United States and particularly in the Russian Federation. In the context of the Russian Federation, do you think that the xenophobia that you mentioned at the start has some ties to Islamist tendencies in the Russian Federation and concerns of politicized religion, providing some challenge to the leadership in the country? Is this enough of a challenge in the Russian Federation or more of a substantial nuisance to the leadership?

Romantsova: If Russia exists in Chechnya and a few other regions and a few more are more Islamic, Chechnya is more important because Kadyrov showed that the Islamic region in the Russian Federation could be in power. We do not know why. I think we know why, but Putin absolutely did not react as if there was any problem with Kadyrov, Chechnya's leader. It is not police, but special forces. He and his troops terroristically controlled Chechnya. They showed Russia that you can be absolutely Islamic and officially accepted. It is the same situation as the Taliban from Afghanistan. Putin officially meets with them. I think Putin showed that if you organize like an Islamic movement. You can even be strong enough that Putin accepts you as part of the dialogue.

The proposed system utilizes surplus energy for electrocoagulation (EC), a method for treating wastewater. ""To meet the industries' water demand and make up for the lack of freshwater supplies, EC is incorporated to treat the discharged wastewater, which is environmentally friendly, especially when electricity is produced from renewable energy sources,"" the scientists explained. ""By incorporating the EC station with hydrogen production-based stand-alone renewable power station, sustainability and mobility can be improved.""

The research group assumed the hydrogen station to be located in Ostrava, in the northeast of the Czech Republic.

Here we take a look at which travel adaptor you need to take with you on your travels whatever your destination.

Do I need an adaptor for travel?

If you are heading overseas and you need to bring along your electronic devices, chances are a travel adaptor will be required.

As there is such a wide range of sockets used around the world, portable plug converters are very useful.

You will need to check which type of socket is used in the region you are travelling to, with the full range being assigned a letter in the alphabet from A through to O.

Why are electric plugs different across the world?

Different technological advances were adopted by different nations at different points in their history.

This means that the plugs they use have changed over time.

Also, electricians, grid planners and engineers from around the world developed their own technologies and grid systems independently, so no universal standard was ever set.

What adaptor do I need?

Making sure you know which adaptor you need to take with you will ensure all your gadgets can remain fully charged.

Knowing what grid and plug type your destination operates on can protect your devices from damage, while ensuring you can capture every moment of your trip.

For example, US appliances run on 110 volts, while European appliances run on 220 volts -- meaning you could blow a fuse if you use the wrong voltage plug.

Only dual voltage items such as laptops can handle being in both countries without problems.

We explain which plugs you might need and how they work when travelling abroad.

Europe

Brits heading on holiday to Europe will need travel adaptor type C, which uses 220 volts.

This plug has two round pins, although some countries have other plug types.

France, Belgium, Poland and the Czech Republic typically use type E, which also utilises grounding clips.

Type E will also accept type C plugs.

Everywhere else in Europe and Russia, travel adaptor type F is used.

This is similar to type C, with two prongs, but it's round and has two grounding clips on each side.

Plug types E, J, K and N can also fit type C travel adaptors.

All of Europe uses two-pin plugs except the UK and Ireland, which have type G three-pin plugs.

US

This destination can trip up even the most wary traveller as different states can have different outlet options.

The US uses type A and type B plugs throughout the different states.

Type A plugs have two flat pins, and can also be used in Canada and Mexico.

Type B plugs are similar, but they have a third rounded pin at the bottom.

However, type B plugs are grounded -- which can prevent electric shocks if the plug is broken.

Dubai

Good news for Brits heading to Dubai, as the country uses the same travel adaptors as the UK -- type G.

The three pronged plug is used throughout Dubai and other places in the United Arab Emirates.

This means no travel adaptor is needed as your regular plugs will fit into the walls.

Other countries in the world to use type G include Ireland, Cyprus, Malta, Malaysia and Singapore.

It is worth noting that many other destinations use this type of connection also, so it is worth checking with your travel operator before planning your trip.

More top travel destinations' plug types and voltages

Yes, travel adaptors can be packed in your suitcase and checked.

This is because there are no dangerous parts in travel adaptors, such as batteries.

They do not store electrical energy, so there is no risk of a fire like there is with batteries, which store electrical energy in the form of chemical energy.

What is a universal travel adaptor?

It is a travel adaptor that can be used in any country around the world.

A universal travel adaptor is the only one you'll ever need, no matter where you are heading.

The gadget removes the need to keep multiple adaptors for different countries.

Can you use a travel adaptor permanently?

Although there are online accounts of people using travel adaptors for years on end without issue, it is not advisable to do so.

The Electrical Safety Council, a charity committed to reducing deaths and injuries caused by electricity, advises that they are not a safe or suitable alternative for continuous use.

It is instead recommended that you convert the plug to that of the region in question, or replace the electrical product with one featuring a standard plug from that country.",thescottishsun.co.uk,news,The Scottish Sun,"Kara Godfrey, Kieran Davies, Jimmy Grant",0.1215686274509804,453229989,1,https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/2jb2h20-woman-applies-universal-european-806388759.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,

Few could claim to enjoy the trust of Azerbaijan's authoritarian leader. But one man could.

He is Baylar Eyyubov, the head of presidential security for the entire two decades of Ilham Aliyev's rule. In event after official event, the thick-set, mustached Eyyubov can be seen hurrying to remain by the president's side and personally opening the doors of his limousine.

In fact, Eyyubov, 73, has served in his role even longer than the president himself. He used to provide the same service to Aliyev's father, Heydar, who ruled Azerbaijan during the country's first decade of post-Soviet independence.

In Azerbaijan, a resource-rich dictatorship that consistently ranks among the world's most corrupt nations, access to wealth and power often depends on proximity to the Aliyevs. So it's no surprise that Eyyubov, who has also married into the ruling family, is widely seen to be influential. But the security chief has always maintained a cloak of secrecy around himself and his relatives.

In a new investigation based on corporate documents and land records in multiple countries, OCCRP, its Azerbaijani partner Mikroskop Media, and its Georgian partner iFact can reveal his family's holdings for the first time. The Eyyubovs own real estate in the United Kingdom and Dubai that cost at least $160 million to acquire.

Their holdings are crowned by three mansions owned by Eyyubov's wife and daughter, Zohra Sultanova and Elvira Eyyubova, all on the same street in an exclusive corner of North London. Elvira also owns two penthouses and a luxury apartment closer to the city center, another apartment in Canterbury, and a house in a seaside Dorset town.

The family holds these U.K. assets through secretive offshore companies that acquired them between 2007 and 2018. Reporters have been unable to trace these firms' sources of financing, and even the fact that they belong to the Eyyubovs has only now emerged because of a 2022 law that requires overseas entities that own British real estate to disclose their beneficial owners. A ""beneficial owner"" is the person who ultimately controls a corporate entity and stands to profit from it. Often this is the same as the legal owner, but in complex corporate structures, the beneficial owner may be hidden behind proxies or other companies.

In Dubai, where real estate ownership data is normally not available to the public, Eyyubov and several family members own villas and office space in their own names, according to leaked documents.

Eyyubov's wife also holds shares in two businesses: a well-reviewed London cafe and an upscale hotel in the Georgian resort town of Batumi. Neither of these was in operation before 2014, meaning they couldn't have contributed to bankrolling the family's real estate purchases.

So for now, the source of the Eyyubovs' wealth remains a mystery. At least until 2020, the last year this information is available, Eyyubov's official annual salary has never exceeded $22,000. His wife's current employment status is unknown, but in 2016 she was listed as an employee of Azerbaijan's State Institute of Botany. His daughter Elvira is a U.K.-based life coach.

The couple have at least five other children, but reporters were not able to establish whether any of them have significant independent sources of income. Azerbaijani corporate records do not reveal the owners of companies, and Tax Ministry data, available online until 2012, only reveals that one of Eyyubov's daughters once co-owned a horse riding club.

Eyyubov also has a wealthy brother named Rafig Hasanov. There is no paper trail showing that he ever gave any money or assets to Eyyubov.

Reporters were able to find just one record of Eyyubov receiving a transfer of cash. In 2007, the same year the family's U.K. property acquisitions began, a company he owned in the British Virgin Islands received $250,000 from a New Zealand shell company. The origin of the money is unknown, but the New Zealand company has been alleged by Danske Bank, where it held an account, to have engaged in money laundering in a separate scandal.

The corporate records examined for this story contained another interesting finding. In both the London cafe and the Georgian hotel, Eyyubov's wife and two of his daughters have a notable business partner: a wealthy Georgian businessman named Sulkhan Papashvili with interests in the Azerbaijani energy sector.

Reporters have uncovered no documentary evidence that Eyyubov or any members of his family received any money or assets from Papashvili. But the circumstances raise questions about the nature of the relationship -- particularly since companies owned by Papashvili's longtime business partner and a relative are also involved in managing the Eyyubov family's real estate.

Eyyubov and his family members did not reply to requests for comment.

In response to reporters' questions, a law firm representing Papashvili wrote that Eyyubov has never been in a position to exert influence in the energy business and that inferring any connection between Papashvili's energy business and his interactions with the Eyyubov family is ""clearly illogical and thus misleading.""

Courtenay Avenue, which runs between the sprawling green acres of Hampstead Heath and the 18-hole Highgate Golf Club, has been described as one of London's most expensive streets.

The Eyyubovs' three mansions on this gated cul-de-sac were purchased for a total of £63 million ($94 million). But in fact that is just a fraction of the money that has been poured into the properties.

Their first house there -- a red-brick and timber mansion known as Somerlese that stood at the end of the street -- no longer exists. Less than two years after acquiring it for £17 million ($26 million) in 2014, the offshore company Vipogo International Ltd. is registered on the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. Documents obtained by reporters show that its ultimate beneficial owner is Eyyubov's wife, Zohra Sultanova. that owns it obtained permission to replace it with an even grander residence.

According to photos posted by its architect on Instagram, the new Somerlese was largely completed by January 2023. A planning document for the three-story, six-bedroom home includes an indoor swimming pool, a gym, a wine cellar, a steam room, a cinema, and living space for multiple staff members. The cost of its construction is unknown.

Just one house away is the family's Branksome mansion. Acquired by another offshore company Capella Assets Ltd. is registered in the Caribbean nation of Saint Lucia. Documents obtained by reporters show its ultimate beneficial owner to be Eyyubov's daughter, Elvira Eyyubova. for £15 million ($20 million) in 2018, it has also been fully demolished and replaced at an unknown cost. Planning documents show that the new six-bedroom ""Branksome"" includes an elevator, a cinema, a games room, a gym, and a pool with a jacuzzi.

The third of the family's Courtney Avenue properties -- the ""Beaulieu"" -- is next door. Land records show that the mansion was purchased by Eyyubov's wife Sultanova for £31 million ($47 million) in 2015 and then transferred to yet another offshore company. Vipogo International LLC is registered on the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts. Documents obtained by reporters show its ultimate beneficial owner to be Eyyubov's wife, Zohra Sultanova.

The Beaulieu, unlike Somerlese and Branksome, has not been razed and rebuilt. In an advertisement posted by the realtor who handled the sale, this home is described as a ""magnificent new mansion"" featuring a ""fusion of classical style with cutting edge technology,"" nine bedrooms (including two for staff) each with their own ""luxury bathroom,"" a large elevator, a sauna, a massage room, and a swimming pool.

Through more offshore companies, Eyyubov's daughter Elvira appears to own The UK records contain a discrepancy: Land records show one set of companies owning four of these properties, while the offshore entities registry with Elvira's name lists identically-named companies in a different jurisdiction. The companies appear to have changed jurisdictions without the land records being updated. an additional five properties in the United Kingdom, purchased for a total of over £12 million ($20 million). One of them -- a 10th floor apartment with floor-to-ceiling windows and views across London -- has been offered for rent at £1,925 (over $2400) per week.

According to her website, Eyyubova runs a life coaching business in London called Coach Soaring Wings. The site reveals little of her background beyond an acknowledgement that she has been ""fortunate enough to be able to visit a variety of countries and discover many cultures.""

Eyyubova's rates -- £120 for six one-hour coaching sessions, or £39 for a single session -- do little to explain her real estate holdings, the first of which was acquired when she was just 20 years old. She did not respond to requests for comment about her assets.

The Eyyubov family's Dubai real estate includes more than a dozen properties held by Eyyubov, Sultanova, and three of his children, including Elvira. Most are villas located on various ""fronds"" of the Palm Jumeirah, an artificial island in the shape of a palm tree.

Eyyubov's glittering portfolio of luxury real estate seems worlds away from his earlier years. In the Soviet era, he reportedly worked for the local Internal Affairs Ministry in the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan.

He was already well-connected, having married the grand-niece of Heydar Aliyev, then a powerful Communist Party boss in Moscow. But the family also lived through lean times, particularly after Aliyev returned to Nakhchivan amid the economic chaos of the Soviet collapse. Aliyev once recalled staying at his sister's home and listening in on conversations between his two grandnieces' husbands, one of whom was Eyyubov, as they struggled to find meat to feed the family.

But by 1993, Aliyev was president of an independent Azerbaijan and the family's fortunes were on the rise.

The other grandniece's husband, Vasif Talibov, became the dictatorial head of Nakhchivan. And Eyyubov was entrusted as the head of presidential security, a position he has retained through the succession of Ilham Aliyev to the presidency and a security service shake-up.

A 2010 report by the International Crisis Group named Eyyubov as one of Azerbaijan's most influential figures, noting that he ""is one of the few people to have constant direct access to the president.""

There have also been claims of impropriety. In a 2008 U.S. diplomatic cable leaked by Wikileak, a French businessman is reported to have claimed that Eyyubov pressured him to sell him a 40-percent stake in one of Azerbaijan's largest local breweries. Allegedly fearing for his multimillion-dollar investment, the businessman sold his stake to a Russian company and left Azerbaijan, saying there were ""too many sharks in the pool.""

OCCRP has not verified this allegation, and Eyyubov did not respond to reporters' questions about it.

Azerbaijani corporate ownership information is not publicly available, making further investigation inside the country difficult. However, the appearance of Eyyubov's name in the Pandora Papers, a leak of nearly 12 million files from 14 offshore corporate service providers obtained by ICIJ, does show that, as early as 2007, he used an offshore company to receive money of unknown origin.

That October, the files show, a Zurich-based bank helped Eyyubov establish a company in the British Virgin Islands for the purpose of holding a bank account. A few months later, the company, called Mente Ventures S.A, received a wire transfer of $250,000 from a company based in New Zealand.

The stated purpose of the payment was ""for stuff foods."" Eyyubov is not known to have done business in the food sector.

No data about the origin of the money is available. But the New Zealand company that sent it, Bigland Corporation Limited, itself shows a pattern of suspicious activity. In addition to being suspected of money laundering by Danske Bank, Bigland was flagged by U.S. prosecutors as being one of the companies that received money from a Russian company involved in the infamous Magnitsky tax fraud. Such companies are often used for multiple purposes, and there is no suggestion that Eyyubov had any involvement with the Magnitsky scheme.

Reporters spent months poring through business registries around the world trying to find corporate traces that would shed more light on the origins of the Eyyubov family's wealth. But while nothing concrete was found that would explain their real estate holdings, the records did reveal something else: A close business relationship with wealthy Georgian businessman Sulkhan Papashvili.

Like Eyyubov, Papashvili was once a security official, heading the Special State Protection Service of Georgia between 1998 and 2003. Among other responsibilities, the service was charged with protecting the president, making him Eyyubov's one-time Georgian counterpart.

The two men's paths soon diverged: Papashvili left government service and became a successful real estate developer. But their personal relationship appears to have endured. When Eyyubov accompanied his boss, President Aliyev, on a state visit to Georgia in October 2023, Papashvili greeted him with a kiss on the cheek at the press conference and shared a table with him at dinner.

In recent years, Papashvili has turned his attention to Azerbaijan, building a massive energy trading business in Georgia that relied on imported Azeri electricity. The trade is run through offshore companies and is notable for its lack of transparency. Furthermore, corporate records show that Papashvili, a man who often handled his affairs, and a longtime business partner were at the same time developing joint businesses with the family members of top Azerbaijani energy officials.

In doing so, these two men received broad powers of attorney that empowered them to undertake an expansive set of actions for the Azeris, including opening and closing bank accounts, withdrawing funds, buying, selling, or gifting real estate, and even receiving correspondence on their behalf.

When asked about his dealings with the family members of Azerbaijani officials, a law firm representing Papashvili wrote: ""The fact that businessmen related to the families of the Azerbaijani officials are engaged in various businesses and/or are acquiring assets in Georgia is not proof of them receiving preferential treatment in any of their business dealings because of Mr. Papashvili."" They also wrote that there was no basis to assert that his business lacks transparency.

While reporters found no evidence that Eyyubov used his influence or connections to help Papashvili, corporate records show that Papashvili helped members of Eyyubov's family launch energy ventures as well: His wife Sultanova acquired a stake in a Papashvili company that bid on a project to build energy transmission towers in Georgia, and his son Eldar had plans to build two hydropower plants with the help of George Kukhaleishvili, Papashvili's longtime business partner. A power of attorney shows Kukhaleishvili being given authorization to act on behalf of Eldar ""as a trusted representative"" in his hydropower company for an unlimited time. (He did not respond to detailed questions about this.)

Neither of these energy projects succeeded, but two other joint businesses did.

One of these is Le Port, a boutique ""Apart Hotel"" occupying a prime waterfront location in the Georgian resort city of Batumi. In 2012, Eyyubov's wife Sultanova acquired a 50-percent stake in Gogebashvili 30 LLC, a Georgian company that subsequently built and now owns the hotel. The other half of the company is owned by Papashvili.

Papashvili's brother Lasha, contacted by reporters because he had also initially invested into the hotel before transferring his interest to Papashvili, provided some insight into the Eyyubov family's participation.

He said that the family had invested $4 million into the hotel, that the money had come from Eyyubov's brother Rafig Hasanov, whom he described as a ""very rich businessman,"" and that Hasanov had assigned the shares to his sister-in-law, Eyyubov's wife Sultanova.

Reporters could find no corporate records showing Hasanov owning any company before 2011, just one year prior to the hotel deal. However, he has indeed grown rich in subsequent years.

The secretive Hasanov, who was only identified through a relative's social media profile and voter registry records, now owns at least $51 million of private and commercial real estate in Dubai and the Czech Republic, according to corporate and land records obtained by reporters. He has also owned assets worth $9 million in Russia at least until 2022, but their current status could not be confirmed. Hasanov did not reply to a request for comment.

The Le Port hotel opened for business in August 2014, but no information is available about its financial performance for its first few years of operation. The available documents show that it operated at a loss between 2018 and 2020.

In 2020, Eyyubov's wife and two of his daughters invested £3 million in a U.K. company called Beangreen Limited, the other owners being Papashvili himself -- through an offshore company in Saint Lucia -- and Kukhaleishvili.

Beangreen owns and operates a London café called Catalyst, along with the building that houses it. Catalyst once received a glowing review in the Evening Standard for its ""inventive, exhilarating, taverna-inspired cooking,"" and Beangreen has been exporting Catalyst-brand coffee to Georgia at least since 2017.

Kukhaleishvili also owns a U.K.-based property management firm called Kornerstone Limited, which provided asset management and administrative services for the redevelopment of both of the Eyyubov family's newly-built mansions on Courtenay Avenue. Eyyubov's wife Sultanova and daughter Elvira list the Kornerstone address as their correspondence address in the U.K.

In response to requests for comment, a law firm representing Kukhaleishvili said that he ""did not manage real estate and companies of the Eyyubov's family members in Georgia and UK (either through Kornerstone or power of attorneys)"" in exchange for any favors or influence. ""Kukhaleishvili and/or Kornerstone business dealings with all their clients are legitimate and proper,"" the firm wrote. ""Kornerstone is proud of that fact that it ensures that all due diligence compliance and regulatory requirements are carried out in relation to its clients.""

In addition, a company co-owned by Lasha Papashvili's wife, Khatuna Parjanadze, was the principal contractor of the Branksome and also worked on the Somerlese.

The company, Rockbridge Limited, also worked on the Ridgefield, another mansion on Courtenay Avenue that lies between two of the Eyyubov's mansions and belongs to Sulkhan Papashvili's wife.

Papashvili and the Eyyubovs are not only neighbors on Courtney Avenue: Sulkhan Papashvili's daughter also owns a penthouse in the Visage Apartments, where Eyyubov's daughter Elvira has three of her London flats.

The law firm responding on behalf of Papashvili did not address reporters' detailed questions about his joint businesses with the Eyyubov family.",occrp.org,news,OCCRP,,0.2313725490196079,453229495,1,https://www.occrp.org/assets/investigations/azer-local-final.jpg,

However, the initiative still has to overcome several energy challenges such as upgrading the outdated infrastructure, ensuring a fair and inclusive transition to a low-carbon economy, harmonizing the legal frameworks among the member states, and meeting the EU's high climate standards. During the political transition, these countries prioritized economic and political reforms over energy challenges. In the 1990s, only the Western countries, thus those outside the Eastern bloc, made significant progress in the energy sector. The production of a unit of GDP in many countries of the Three Seas Initiative has been more costly than in Western Europe. Therefore, these states are striving to align their economic and energy policies with the EU standards.

The Three Seas region is a group of countries that vary in geography, climate, economy, and economic resources. Each of them uses different sources of energy and emits different amounts of greenhouse gases. To show how diverse the Three Seas region is, let us look at some of the countries in this group. Lithuania relies mainly on gas, biofuels, and renewables, and seeks to diversify its energy sources. It has no intention to build nuclear plants shortly, though. similarly, Estonia's parliament adopted a renewable electricity target of 100 percent by 2030. Contrary to what it may seem, Hungary's energy system has a relatively low carbon intensity. The country relies on coal for only about a dozen or so of its energy mix. State plan authorities to increase their use of renewable energy sources and invest in new nuclear reactors at the Paks power plant. Hungary increased its solar power capacity by nearly 1 gigawatt in 2022. The Czech Republic is also phasing out coal and expanding its nuclear energy sector to secure its energy independence.

The Three Seas countries and other Central and Eastern European nations are undergoing a fast energy transition, driven by the EU's stricter climate policy. Diversifying energy sources became more important after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. As the Kremlin's influence in the region has weakened over the past two years, energy prices have risen, especially for fossil fuels that were once largely imported from the east. One thing is certain: the region is undergoing a transformation that will involve reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

The region has a lot of scope for developing renewable technologies, even though coal and gas have been and are still the main sources of energy for many of its economies. Offshore wind power plants are very feasible for the countries on the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. Northern countries like Poland and the Baltic states can invest in both offshore and onshore energy, even though they use different types of energy sources. Conversely, countries like Slovenia, Romania, and Hungary, which are situated in the central-southern region of the Three Seas, are known for their significant potential in producing solar energy. The advancement of renewable energy sources is crucial for the Three Seas Initiative because it can help mitigate the continuous increase in energy costs. In the journey of energy transition, particularly for economies heavily reliant on coal, gas serves as an excellent bridge fuel. This is evident from the investments made by countries in the region, such as the doubling of the LNG terminal capacity in Croatia, the construction of the FSRU terminal near Gdańsk, and the expansion of the Polish LNG terminal's capacity from 5 to 8.3 billion cubic meters annually.

Without a doubt, the year 2030 will be a significant milestone for Europe in terms of both political and climate-related developments. In the political sphere, there is a growing discussion within the EU forum about plans to extend the union by incorporating a country from the Western Balkans. In terms of climate and energy policies, 2030 marks the completion of certain frameworks established by the European Union. Indeed, it is important to acknowledge that within a strict framework, certain countries may struggle to meet their individual objectives. Indeed, if we expand our view beyond just the Three Seas countries, and if the economic and energy development in Central and Eastern Europe continues at its current pace, with transformations that are equitable and customized to each economy, we could anticipate a significant increase in the capacity of wind and solar power plants in this region. The capacity could rise from the current 35 gigawatts to 196 gigawatts by 2030. This increase could potentially reduce energy prices by up to a third and enable the export of up to 20 gigawatts of electricity post-2030. In 2022 alone, the total capacity of solar and wind power plants in Central and Eastern Europe saw an increase of less than 30 percent. This suggests a potential for this trend to continue, further contributing to the region's energy development and transformation.

There is a clear political desire for transformation within the energy sector in the countries involved in the Three Seas Initiative. It is important to note that in the Central and Eastern European region, political support is significantly influenced by energy prices. This, in turn, affects the stance of individual governments towards investments in the energy sector. The Baltic states have set a goal to disconnect their energy systems from the Russian grid by 2025. Following this, they plan to subsequently connect to the continental European grid. Indeed, Latvia and Estonia are also participating in the development of offshore wind farms. Another noteworthy example is the collaboration between Hungary and Romania, along with Azerbaijan and Georgia. They have signed a memorandum to develop an underwater electric cable that will run through the Black Sea. The investment is intended to bolster the export of energy to Europe. Hungary is a country that has significant geothermal potential. As a testament to this, the first geothermal power plant was connected to their national grid in late 2017. An excellent illustration of future collaboration is the proposal by Romania and Bulgaria to construct a shared energy island. For Poland, which has an economy heavily reliant on coal, there have been numerous investments and strategies developed in recent years. The goal of these initiatives is to achieve energy independence and ensure a stable supply of natural gas to the Central and Eastern Europe region. Several significant projects stand out, including the Baltic Pipe, the enlargement of the LNG terminal in Świnoujście, the introduction of a new FSRU terminal, the development of nuclear reactors in collaboration with the United States and South Korea, and the implementation of small modular reactors (SMRs).

The success of the energy transition not only relies on top-down decisions but also significantly depends on the collaborative efforts of the private sector, the public sector, and the general public. An excellent illustration of public involvement is the widespread support for the ""My Electricity"" government program in Poland. The initiative aimed to offer a co-funding sum of as much as PLN 5,000 for the setup of solar panel systems in domestic houses. The considerable interest shown by the beneficiaries led to the construction of close to 10 gigawatts of photovoltaic energy between 2020 and 2023.

The partnership within the Three Seas Initiative is consistently progressing and it is undeniably a framework that deserves consideration, especially in the light of the current geopolitical system. Moving forward, the significance of investments in interconnectors cannot be overstated. Such investments will facilitate the delivery of electricity, produced from offshore wind energy at sea, to areas of demand. This calls for, among other initiatives, the deployment of bridging systems and the expansion of cross-border networks to harness the advantages. In addition, the transition of many countries to nuclear energy can benefit others. This is because nuclear power stations in a particular country can have a substantial impact on the regional energy composition, especially through grid interconnections.

The proposed system utilizes surplus energy for electrocoagulation (EC), a method for treating wastewater. ""To meet the industries' water demand and make up for the lack of freshwater supplies, EC is incorporated to treat the discharged wastewater, which is environmentally friendly, especially when electricity is produced from renewable energy sources,"" the scientists explained. ""By incorporating the EC station with hydrogen production-based stand-alone renewable power station, sustainability and mobility can be improved.""

The research group assumed the hydrogen station to be located in Ostrava, in the northeast of the Czech Republic. The city averages solar radiation of 2.89 kWh/m2 daily and wind speed of about 5.69 m/s. Hydrogen demand for the station is assumed at 10 kg per hour or 240 kg per day. The proposed system consists of wind turbines, PV panels, an electrolyzer, an inverter, hydrogen tanks, and batteries. All are assumed to have a lifetime of less than 25 years.

""The optimal design of the plant determines the size of the components as follows: photovoltaic panels with a capacity of 298 kW, 22 wind turbines with 100 kW each, 30 strings of 1 kWh lead acid battery, electrolyzer of 1000 kW capacity, and hydrogen tanks with a capacity of 800 kg,"" they further explained.

Their analysis showed that the PV unit can generate up to 300,425 kWh/year and the wind turbine 6,697,566 kWh/year. The electrolyzers' annual energy consumption is around 3,972,059 kW, and their annual production is estimated at 85,595 kg. In addition, 262,678 kWh of electricity is generated annually for the electrocoagulation plant.

Through their techno-economic analysis, the academics found the system may already achieve significantly low price levels for the hydrogen it produces. ""The levelized cost of hydrogen (LCH) is 2.89 € ($3.12)/kg of hydrogen while net present cost (NPC) is €5.49 million excluding compressor unit costs,"" they concluded. ""The wind turbine and electrolyzer system have the highest NPC. Consequently, the overall NPC of the project and the LCH will be significantly impacted by the growth or decrease of the corresponding costs of wind farms and electrolyzers.""

Their findings can be found in ""An optimal standalone wind-photovoltaic power plant system for green hydrogen generation: A case study for hydrogen refueling station,"" published in Results in Engineering.

They argue that bloc must not only pay more attention to non-EU operators, but take greater responsibility over its own energy system. What are your views?

The EU's climate agenda is in trouble. The Green Deal, which aims to slash the bloc's carbon emissions by 55% by 2030, had started off promisingly after several major pieces of legislation were adopted, including its ban on the sale of new combustion-powered vehicles from 2035 and new carbon border tax. Increasingly, however, Europeans are rebelling against green restrictions of which they have difficulty seeing the advantages.

Another less reported upon but equally important threat to the bloc's ecological and energy transition comes from the alarming number of Chinese and US companies moving into the EU power sector.

In our book, Energy: How to Recover Our European Ambition (published in French), we shed light on this overlooked issue ahead of European elections that will be critical for the EU's energy strategy, and call on the bloc to carefully weigh up cooperation and competition with sovereignty.

While there currently isn't any quantitative data on China's share in the European energy market, we do know the country detains 80% of the global clean-technology manufacturing capacity in 11 segments, from solar wafers to many lithium-ion battery components.

Taking advantage of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, Chinese investors first stepped in to acquire substantial stakes in what have long been regarded as ""sovereign"" sectors, such as power transmission and distribution grids, in the early 2010s. Key among those was the world's largest utility company, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), commonly known as the State Grid - the world's fourth-biggest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart, Saudi Aramco and Amazon as of March. Also increasingly present is Three Gorges Corp, responsible for the world's largest hydroelectric power complex.

For instance, in Portugal, Three Gorges Corp. won the bidding for the Portuguese government's 21% stake in EDP-Energias de Portugal SA in 2010. Meanwhile, in Italy, SGCC expanded its presence by collaborating with the Italian government in 2014, acquiring a 35% share in the CDP Reti fund, thereby attaining a blocking minority at the local gas network operator, SNAM, and electricity transmission network operator, Terna. Similarly, in Greece the State Grid made substantial inroads by acquiring a 24% stake in the national electricity transmission network operator from the Greek government in 2016.

While Portugal, Italy, and Greece were primary targets, Chinese investors have also acquired grids in Luxembourg. Last but not least, let's not forget China's green-tech industry has flooded Europe with cheap solar panels and electric vehicles (EVs).

The stakes are all the higher because China is not the only country with ambitions in the EU: The United States is also seeking to benefit from the bloc's poorly thought-out energy strategy.

Russia's war against Ukraine has not weakened the United States' energy dominance in the world, and more specifically in the EU. Indeed, while Russian gas was expected to act as a bridge fuel in the energy transition, particularly for Germany, the EU was quick to adopt sanctions against its long-term trade partner that minimised its dependence. Partly filling the vacant space left by Moscow, the United States has become the leading producer and exporter of LNG to Europe. This development favours US trade while domestic energy costs are kept low, further widening the price gap, with Europe experiencing an energy inflation and undermining its relative competitiveness and attractiveness to energy-intensive industry.

Beyond these energy-supply issues, EU member states are struggling to carve out a common vision, highlighting the challenges of sovereignty and strategic autonomy. European companies, particularly in France, have endeavoured to develop fourth-generation small modular nuclear reactors (SMR), with an attempt to create a European nuclear alliance made in November 2023. But at the same moment, countries such as Italy, Belgium, and Romania have partnered with the American Westinghouse Electric Company to develop lead-cooled fast reactors.

Here again, the coordination gap plays to the advantage of American influence in Europe, as confirmed by John Kerry in September 2023. As part of the international consortium ""Clean Fuel from SMR"", led by American companies, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland were selected to participate and will receive support for coal-to-SMR feasibility studies. These EU countries are turning to the Americans to build new nuclear power plants, mainly because of their funding and technical expertise, while the EU continues to block all support for nuclear projects developed on its soil.

The scale of these foreign investments in renewable energies, new nuclear facilities and grid development could come to bear heavily onto the bloc's strategic independence at a time when it's looking to decarbonise.

These investments raise concerns over continental energy security, given the still fragmented nature of Europe's energy landscape:

The main challenge for Europe is ending one dependency without falling into another. To replace imports of fossil fuels (coal, gas, and oil), harmful to the climate, the EU member states must accelerate and coordinate the development of their ""green"" technologies.

These risks demand that the bloc not only pays more attention to non-EU operators, but take greater responsibility over its own energy system. How can it do this, all while pursuing the vision of the ""green, secure and affordable energy supply"" set out in its Green Deal?

For starters, we recommend EU member states work harder on building truly European energy grids. As we move toward decarbonisation, we can expect an array of renewable energies to increasingly power our electricity system. These arrangements will require extensive and interconnected networks on a European scale, which must be consolidated and developed by the EU member states themselves.

A second emergency is green energy financing. In November, the European Climate Neutrality Observatory warned a lack of EU-level public investment in green energy and other advances could lead the bloc to fail to meet its net-zero goals. Rather than take heed of the warning, member states axed the fund earmarked for renewables and clean tech - the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) - to 1.5bn in February. Our book calls for a radical change of strategy, through the creation of a ""European transition savings account"" to attract private savings, on the one hand, and a ""European sovereign fund"" that receives proceeds from carbon-pricing revenues on the other.

Whether these actually come into being will depend on the upcoming European elections. Results leaning toward a higher European ambition could help us see in clean, affordable and secure solutions. At the other end of the spectrum, further veering to the nationalistic right could carry harmful effects for the bloc's economic clout and, paradoxically, sovereignty.",energyindemand.com,news,Energy in Demand - Sustainable Energy - Rod Janssen,Rod Janssen,0.0117647058823529,453032450,7,https://energyindemand.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/icon-04.png?w=240,

It has been a long week. Everyone is, I'm sure worn out. So far, Rosie seems to be tolerating her third chemo treatment much better than her first two. I want to thank everyone for the good thoughts, kind wishes, and prayers for her. Also, there was a misfire with the GoFundMe. Nothing involving what TaMara did, just some back end issues that have to be resolved. Which is why I asked TaMara to pull it down for now. She has and anyone that already donated will be getting a full refund. Thank you all so much, but for now it's not going forward. Should we get the issues resolved, things change, and we put it back up, we'll let everyone know. But I do want anyone who did donate and who is getting a refund to know that I appreciate what you did very, very, very much!

As I have been writing tonight's update, so about the past 20 minutes - it's now 6:50 PM EDT - the air raid alerts have begun to go up over Ukraine. When I started writing around 6:30 PM EDT, air raid alerts were up over Luhansk and Crimea, which is normal as they are always up over Luhansk and Crimea. They were also up over Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblasts. Over the past twenty minutes air raid alerts have gone up over Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts.

It's now 7:10 PM EDT and the air raid alerts for Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts have been taken down.

The Russians hammered Sumy Oblast again today. And by hammered, I mean attempted to pulverize!

Russian forces attacked Sumy Oblast 302 times in 60 separate attacks throughout the day, firing at 11 communities along the border on May 9, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported.

The communities of Bilopillia, Yunakivka, Khotin, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Shalyhyne, Novoslobidske, Seredyna-Buda, Esman, Myropillia, and Putyvl were targeted.

Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with mortar, drone, rockets, and artillery attacks, while dropping explosives from drones onto two of the communities.

No casualties or injuries were reported.

The town of Velyka Pysarivka, located directly on Ukraine-Russia border, with a pre-war population of about 4,000 residents, experienced the bulk of the attacks reported with 67 explosions recorded in the area.

Given the town's proximity to Russia, Velyka Pysarivka has become a main target of attack for Russia over recent months. Much of the community's infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian attacks.

Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months. Amid intensified attacks, Ukrainian authorities ordered increased evacuations from the region.

Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region's vulnerable border settlements experience multiple attacks per day.

The Russians have not forgotten about and are not finished with Kharkiv:

Dear Ukrainians!

The key points for today.

I held a meeting with the leadership of the Ukrainian Defense Forces: Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Barhylevych, and Defense Minister Umerov. We discussed how to speed up the supply of weapons from our partners and how to act now, with the available forces and means, with the available weapons, to achieve the results we need. We see what the occupier is preparing for. There will be a response. And I thank all our soldiers and commanders, every unit that is effectively operating at the front and destroying the occupier. The Kraken unit of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine deserves special gratitude for its fighting these days. I am grateful to you, guys! And to everyone who gives Ukraine the result. The result we need so much. Today, I have also appointed Oleksandr Trepak as a new commander of the Special Operations Forces. He is a decent man, a strong warrior, a Hero of Ukraine.

The second for today. The visit of the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola to Ukraine. It is very symbolic that today, on Europe Day, our conversation with journalists was interrupted by an air raid alert. This is what the Russian Nazis want to replace life with, not just in Ukraine, but in our entire Europe, wherever their terrorist strikes reach. They will neither intimidate nor break Ukraine, nor will they break all those who bravely and resolutely help us defend life. Madam President of the European Parliament is exactly the kind of leader who has been with us since the first days of this war, and has always supported us as much as we need. Today, we discussed with Roberta what other political and defense steps are needed to ensure that we can truly withstand all the attacks and thwart Russia's offensive and destabilization plans.

Today I would also like to thank all the participants of the Second Summit of Ukrainian and European Communities held here in Kyiv. The countries of the European Union, as well as the United States, were represented. It is very important that there are cooperation agreements between our communities and the communities and companies of partner countries: Germany, Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, Austria, Romania, and the United States. These include the development of healthcare in Ukraine, rehabilitation opportunities in our communities, as well as the development of transport, recovery. I am grateful to all the participants of the Summit - every community, every country that stands with Ukraine, filling each of the agreements reached with real cooperation.

And of course, there was a lot of international communication today. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel. Also, I have just spoken with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. We are actively preparing the next stage of rapprochement with the European Union for June - we anticipate the adoption of the negotiating framework and the actual start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession. Our country, our people deserve this. And the European Union needs this step not just politically, as it is the lifeblood of the European Union to be a European project that leaves no one outside the EU, no one who truly professes European values. And I was also pleased today to hear the full support of our European friends for the Peace Summit - I am grateful to every leader who has already confirmed their participation in the Summit and is willing to help us effectively in engaging leaders.

Today, in conversations, I personally invited the Presidents of Moldova, the Czech Republic and Ghana, as well as the Prime Minister of Ireland to the Summit. Of course, we also discussed our bilateral agenda. Moldova - we have obvious common challenges and help each other. The Czech Republic - I expressed my gratitude for the initiative on artillery, and the most important thing now is the full and immediate implementation of the initiative. Ghana - the world relies on the stability and development of Africa. We have recently opened an embassy in Ghana, and this country now has a new accredited ambassador in Kyiv. Together we can add more strength to our parts of the world. Ireland - I thanked them for their support of our state and people, I thanked them for the fact that Ireland is really trying to help us politically, and also in the protection of life - in the demining of our land. And this support will increase - more territory of Ukraine will be cleared of Russian mines and ordnance.

So, this day and this week added support to our warriors, our state, our diplomacy. and to the Peace Summit. Every day in the diplomatic marathon, we are making the Peace Summit and the approach of peace a reality. Thank you to all the leaders who help!

I thank everyone who defends Ukraine and life! I thank everyone who gives us strength!

Glory to Ukraine!

⚡️Germany to buy 3 HIMARS for Ukraine.

Germany will buy three HIMARS multiple rocket launchers for Ukraine, the country's defense minister announced on May 9. Speaking during a trip to Washington, Boris Pistorius said they would be purchased from the U.S. and handed over to Kyiv.

⚡️Bloomberg: Pentagon blocks Russian military from accessing Starlink in Ukraine.

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

https://kyivindependent.com/bloomberg-pentagon-blocks-russian-military-from-accessing-starlink-in-ukraine/

Frankly I'm amazed by this. Here are the details from The Kyiv Independent:

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

Starlink, recognized for its superior security compared to cellular or radio signals, is deemed crucial for Ukrainian operations. Last year, the Pentagon reached an agreement with SpaceX to financially support access for the Ukrainian military.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's military intelligence chief told the Wall Street Journal that Russian forces in Ukraine are using thousands of Starlink satellite communications terminals made by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

According to Plumb, the U.S. has become ""heavily involved in working with the government of Ukraine and SpaceX to counter Russian illicit use of Starlink terminals.""

Ukraine heavily depends on Starlink, having reported last year that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.

""At this time we have successfully countered Russian use, but I am certain Russia will continue to try and find ways to exploit Starlink and other commercial communications systems,"" Plumb said. ""It will continue to be a problem, I think we've wrapped our heads around it and found good solutions with both Starlink and Ukraine.""

The American official did not specify what tactics are being used to block Russian access to Starlink terminals inside Ukraine.

Following the publication of Budanov's interview with the WSJ, two Democrats in the U.S. Congress, Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, opened an investigation into Elon Musk's SpaceX company, demanding information on Russia's alleged usage of the Starlink satellite internet terminals.

Ukraine's military intelligence said that Russia has allegedly been purchasing Starlink terminals from ""Arab countries,"" citing intercepted communications.

Elon Musk denied that SpaceX had sold Starlink units to Russia and said Starlink would not connect to any devices there.

Both military intelligence and media reports said that Russian forces connected Starlink in occupied Ukraine, not on Russian territory.

Plumb affirmed that SpaceX has become a ""reliable partner"" in Ukraine.

""To me, they're a very reliable partner, and they are also 'innovating at speed,' providing services that are useful to the Defense Department.""

SpaceX began providing the Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The potential/expected Russian spring offensive:

""This used to be an old Soviet radio station, but we have gutted it and installed this equipment given to us by volunteers. We did it all ourselves,"" Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Timchenko, commander of the air-defence unit, says proudly. Plots on the monitor show the flight paths of Russian jets, helicopters and missiles. Lines showing Smerch rockets travelling at 1,400kph (900mph) criss-cross the screen; one heads directly towards the hamlet, but passes overhead. A Russian warplane comes close to the front, releases its bomb and makes a -turn. Less than a minute later the glide bomb (a regular bomb fitted with fins to greatly increase its range) disappears from the screen, exploding well inside Ukraine.

Colonel Timchenko's air-defence unit cannot hit the Russian planes and has no way of intercepting glide bombs. Its job is to warn artillery units and mobile groups operating along the front. Hidden in the brush on a hill a few kilometres from the hamlet, three of the battalion's 250 men huddle around a Strela-10, an old Soviet short-range mobile surface-to-air missile system. Designed to bring down planes, it now hunts Russian drones. In the eight months that Colonel Timchenko has been here his men have shot down 50.

Tall and composed, the commander is a Russian-speaker from Kharkiv. He has been fighting since February 2015, a year after Vladimir Putin first invaded Crimea and the eastern Donbas, supposedly to ""save"" Russian-speakers like him. The war, he says, is not about language, ethnicity or even territory, but a way of life. ""I don't want to be part of Russia. I don't want to go to prison for expressing my opinions. I want my children to grow up in a normal country, maybe not a rich country, but a free country."" An avid reader of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, he does not want to live in a new ""Gulag Archipelago"".

The purpose of the fighting around Chasiv Yar is not to retain every inch of land, but to prevent the Russian army from sweeping across the rest of Ukraine and taking its main cities, including Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odessa and Kyiv. Similarly, Mr Putin is not interested in the Donbas for its territory; he is trying to subjugate Ukraine and end its quest to become part of the European order. Last week Emmanuel Macron, France's president, told The Economist that this order could perish ""much more quickly than we think"". Ukraine is where the fight is taking place.

A year ago, as Ukraine readied for its counter-offensive, just holding its own positions was considered the most pessimistic scenario. Now, as Russia prepares for a fresh push, it is considered the best case. From soldiers to generals, everyone The Economist spoke to over the past week knows that Ukraine lacks the resources to get back to its 1991 borders, as its politicians have promised. ""I suggest to anyone who talks of 1991 borders to come as far as Bakhmut,"" Colonel Timchenko says, referring to a town Ukraine lost a year ago after months of savage fighting.

At stake now is not Ukraine's territorial integrity, but its survival. Slowing Russian forces in the Donbas is crucial. Colonel Pavlo Fedosenko, commander of the 92nd, who helped liberate Kharkiv province in September 2022, is now fighting some 350km south-east of the city. ""Everyone knows that if we don't fight for Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka [Russia's probable next target], Russian forces will be in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih a few weeks later,"" he says. He thinks there is a ""70% chance"" that Russia can occupy the rest of the Donbas region. The question is how long it might take, and how much damage Ukraine can inflict in the process.

Fearing escalation, the West has never given Ukraine all the weapons it needs. After a six-month gap in American supplies caused by Republican obstruction, it has enough ammunition to survive but not to defeat Russia's forces. By the time a new American aid package was approved on April 24th, it was rationing ammunition. Colonel Fedosenko says he was down to five shells a day for his American Paladin howitzers. ""What am I supposed to do with this number of shells? My men were fighting with spades in trenches."" He hopes the $61bn package's effects will be felt in days, as many of the weapons have been pre-positioned in Poland.

Although Russia has the edge in shells and manpower, Colonel Fedosenko feels it may have reached its peak. Only a few weeks ago, he says, Russian infantry backed by ten to 20 armoured vehicles and tanks were launching assaults every two to three hours. Now they attack only every five days or so, using motorcycles and quad bikes to avoid kicking up dust and advancing in small groups to hunt for weak spots.

Some 70% of the Russian soldiers in such assaults are former convicts, says Colonel Fedosenko. He also sees Tajik, Uzbek, Turkmen, Cuban and Somali mercenaries. Many soldiers have never been in combat before. ""Our interceptions suggest they are scraping the barrel, using whoever they can force into battle -- cooks, builders, mechanics, anyone."" He knows that many Russian soldiers have no choice. ""Most of the prisoners I take are guys from small towns and villages. They tell us that either they get killed here or they get killed there if they run."" Some shoot themselves rather than surrender.

For now, however, Russian forces continue to advance. While Ukraine is not collapsing, it is losing about 20 sq km a week. Mr Putin may want to inflict maximum damage before 's 75th anniversary party in July, to humiliate the West and force Ukraine into negotiations. But since he has not advertised his fresh offensive he would not need to admit its failure either.

Meanwhile, Mr Putin is strangling Ukraine's economy by knocking out much of its electricity generation and wearing down the civilian population by bombing cities. Kharkiv, which is already rationing electricity, is being hit by glide bombs almost daily. Yet the city of more than 1m people is keeping calm and carrying on. On a sunny afternoon last week, residents strolled through a park and attendants went on emptying rubbish bins, even as two glide bombs landed with huge explosions less than a kilometre away. Keeping the city functioning and clean is a way to stand up to destruction and chaos.

With around 50,000 fresh Russian troops gathering across the border some 40km away, Kharkiv's commanders know they may be a target in Russia's next push. One scenario would be to isolate the city by cutting the main road to Kyiv. Another would be to move some 10km closer, putting the city's eastern outskirts within artillery range and creating a buffer zone to protect Belgorod, a Russian city that is being hit by Ukrainian drones.

Konstantin Nemichev is the commander of the famous Kraken regiment, a special-forces outfit formed in the early days of the invasion in 2022 that defended Kharkiv. He expects the enemy to attack the province again in mid-May, but reckons they will fail to get near the city. Interviewed outside a ruined school building in the east of town, the site of an intense firefight in 2022 in which invading soldiers were wiped out, the commander says the defence is much stronger now. It has three lines of fortifications and a full brigade to stop the Russians. ""They can move a few kilometres into the province,"" he says, ""but I don't think they can get as far as 10km.""

The Ukrainian armed forces know they have no choice but to fight on. ""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region. But this sense of urgency and existential threat, he says, needs to penetrate into the whole of Ukrainian society. ""People need to know the truth,"" he says. And Ukraine needs unity as it enters a new stage of conflict.

I want to reemphasize LTC Tkach's assessment:

""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region.

Those, as well as Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state and Ukrainians existence as Ukrainians, are the stakes!

Professor Snyder has posted a new explainer of Russian propaganda. From the Thread Reader App:

President Zelenskyy continues to shake up his senior national security team. From The Kyiv Independent:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the head of Ukraine's State Security Administration (UDO), Serhii Rud, according to a presidential decree published on May 9.

The UDO's main tasks include ensuring the security of the President of Ukraine and high-ranking officials of the state, as well as the protection of administrative buildings and objects of state authorities of Ukraine.

Rud's dismissal comes shortly after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed to have uncovered a network of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) agents who were plotting to assassinate President Zelensky and other high-ranking officials in Ukraine. Two colonels of the UDO accused of leaking classified information to Russia were reportedly detained.

The FSB network aimed to find perpetrators among the military close to Zelensky's security, ""who could take the head of state hostage and then kill him.""

Just a few weeks before, SBU officials and Polish law enforcement worked to detain a Polish citizen who allegedly offered to Russia to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In late November, Zelensky said in an interview with The Sun that he had survived at least five assassination attempts since the start of Russia's full-scale war.

The Ukrainian president issued several presidential decrees this week mandating changes in senior leadership across Ukraine's government and military.

Dmytro Hereha was reappointed as the commander of Ukraine's Support Forces, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, was formally dismissed from military service. Zaluzhnyi will now serve as Ukraine's ambassador to the U.K.

Russian sources are claiming the Mariupol strike was ATACMS:

A video of the drone attacking the plant in Russian Salavat, Bashkiria, appeared on Russian Telegram channels.

The person who is filming says the drone is very large.

It looks like the drone flew about 1,500 km before it reached its target and hit the oiloil catalytic cracking unit.

Gazprom neftekhim Salavat is one of the largest oil refining and petrochemical production complexes in Russia. It specializes in the production of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other types of petroleum products.

/6. According to Russian media Baza:

""the drone hit the catalytic cracking unit at about one o'clock in the afternoon, local time. Afterwards, employees of the enterprise heard a bang and saw smoke in the area of the Southern entrance. The fire was small, so workers were not evacuated; the plant is operating normally.

According to the head of the Republic of Bashkortostan, Radiy Khabirov, emergency services and heads of law enforcement agencies are now working on the spot. Preliminary, no one was hurt.""

This report segments the Waste Management Market based on waste type into six categories: Hazardous Waste, E-Waste, Municipal Solid Waste, Medical Waste, Construction & Demolition, Non-Hazardous Industrial waste. The Non-Hazardous Industrial Waste management's segment is expected to be the fastest-growing segment. Factors such as expanding oil production, rising municipal solid trash per capita, rising construction activity, economic expansion, and an aging population are major drivers of market growth for non-hazardous waste management services. Additionally, developments such as vertical integration, expanding commercial franchise zones, outsourcing, greater governmental support, and rising demand for environmental services all have a significant impact on the growth of non-hazardous waste management services.

Based on, the disposal method, Waste Management Market is segmented into five categories: Open Dumping, Incineration/Combustion, Landfill, Recycling, Composting & Anaerobic Digestion. The Landfill waste management segment is expected to be the largest segment during the forecast period. Landfills effectively manage non-hazardous solid waste by disposing of non-recyclable garbage. Modern landfills are well-engineered and can handle numerous waste types, making them prominent in the waste management business. Furthermore, the growing population and large solid waste generation, particularly from residential sources, boost need for waste management services, which frequently end up in landfills. Additionally, the residential segment contributes heavily to garbage generation, with families producing a variety of waste that frequently ends up in landfills, underscoring landfills' role in the waste management business.

This report segments Waste Management Market based on source type into three categories: Residential, Commercial & Industrial source. The commercial segment is expected to be the second largest segment by source during the forecast period. It includes physical pickup and transfer of waste produced by businesses to a place where it can be treated or disposed of. Schools, offices, hotels and restaurants, stores, hospitals, prisons, and government centers fall under this category. The segment covers waste in the form of appliances, crockery products, FMCG products, stationery, consumer durables, and packaging materials. The Waste Management Market in this sector is projected to witness moderate growth due to rapid urbanization and the booming hospitality sector. The recycling of commercial waste includes collection, sorting, and recycling of waste, which can be done either by a municipality or a private recycling firm.

North America is expected to be the largest region in the Waste Management Industry.

The dense population and rapid urban development in the area result in a notable volume of waste from residential, commercial, and industrial activities. This situation necessitates the implementation of comprehensive waste management systems and infrastructure. Moreover, the United States, being the largest contributor to waste due to its population size, generates a significant portion of the world's municipal solid waste. In North America, the waste management sector benefits from efficient industrial waste management techniques, an increasing focus on environmental cleanliness, and the primary industrial sectors such as electricity, pharmaceuticals, and oil and gas, which are major consumers of waste management services. Stringent government regulations in the U.S. and Canada have spurred the collection and disposal of industrial waste, further stimulating the waste management industry in the region. It has headquarters of many big waste management companies such as WM Intellectual Property Holdings, L.L.C. (US), Republic Services (US) & Waste Connections (US).

The company is due to make a decision on terminating operations at the mining site in the coming months. It has said previously it expected CSA's closure between 2024 and 2026.

""Mining will be ended in a controlled manner in the next few months,"" Severni Energeticka Chief Executive Petr Lenc said.

""For now it is an suspension of mining. If a need appears for our coal in electricity or heat production in the winter time, we are prepared to partially resume operations.""

Mining at CSA has been gradually reduced since 2015, when the government maintained mining limits in the region.

The Czech Republic is in the gradual process of shifting away from coal, and coal-fired plants are becoming more uncompetitive.

Pavel Tykac, the billionaire owner of Sev.en, told Reuters last year that coal-fired plants would be running at a loss from 2026 but remain indispensable for the national grid.

Coal-fired plants have been squeezed by costs of carbon emission allowances and a falling number of hours in the year when they can sell at profitable prices.

But they still have an important role in supplying power, especially at times of high demand or low supply from renewable sources. (Reporting by Jason Hovet; Editing by Alan Charlish and Mark Potter)",dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,,0.03529411764705892,452947495,1,,

The Board of Directors of the European Investment Bank (EIB) today approved an updated definition of dual-use goods and infrastructure eligible for EIB Group financing and agreed to facilitate financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the security and defence industry, by opening up dedicated intermediated financing.

The Board also approved €4.5 billion in new financing for projects, including in the strategic priority areas of climate action, technological innovation and agriculture.

""We are stepping up our support for Europe's security and defence industry, strengthening investment to keep Europe and its citizens safe, while safeguarding the EIB Group's financing capacity,"" EIB President Nadia Calviño said.

Revamped rules for security and defence financing

Boosting EIB Group support to safeguard Europe's peace and security is one of the top strategic priorities, outlined by President Calviño to EU Finance Ministers in February. Following intensive consultations with the Bank's shareholders, financial markets and key stakeholders, and the European Council's mandate to further improve access to finance for European security and defence firms, President Calviño unveiled an immediate Security and Defence Industry Action Plan at the last EU Finance Ministers meeting (ECOFIN), where the initiative received broad support.

Today's Board of Directors meeting formally adopted the Action Plan. Going forward, the EIB will waive a previous requirement that dual-use projects eligible for financing in the area of security and defence derive more than 50% of their expected revenues from civilian use. Projects and infrastructure used by the military or police that also serve civilian needs will now be eligible for EIB Group financing. There will no longer be a minimum threshold for expected revenues from civilian applications or share of civilian users.

The EIB Group will also update its rules for security and defence SME financing. This will open dedicated credit lines managed by banks in EU Member States and other intermediaries for dual-use projects by smaller companies and innovative startups. EU companies whose activity is partly in defence will be eligible for financing using EIB-backed intermediated credit lines. No further changes were made to the EIB Group's eligibility, excluded activities and excluded sectors list.

The EIB Group has created a dedicated Security and Defence Office, providing a one-stop shop for security and defence investment, operational since 1 May 2024. It offers streamlined financial support and expert assistance aimed at strengthening Europe's security and defence capabilities.

The changes are expected to speed up investment and improve access to EIB Group financing for the European security and defence sector, deploying €6 billion in funding available under the Strategic European Security Initiative (SESI), and the European Investment Fund's (EIF) Defence Equity Facility, and further boosting the EIB Group's already considerable support to the European security and defence industry.

€4.5 billion for innovation, business, transport and agriculture investment

The Board today also approved €4.5 billion of new financing for renewable energy, agriculture, sustainable transport and business investment.

""The financing will have an impact in creating skilled jobs, increasing renewable energy generation and enhancing sustainable transport infrastructure to improve lives and opportunities and to contribute to a greener and more resilient future for all,"" said EIB President Nadia Calviño.

The Board approved €1 billion of new business financing. Sustainability-focused corporate research and innovation across Europe will be supported by a dedicated pan-European venture debt initiative and new cooperation with local financing partners to scale up business financing in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Armenia and Azerbaijan, while access to finance to enable companies to expand and create jobs will be enhanced by new business financing programmes with banking partners in Spain and the Czech Republic. The first financing programme for agribusiness and agricultural cooperatives in Senegal, under the EIB's pan-African agriculture financing initiative, and support for agricultural and rural development investment in Spain were also approved.

The EIB backed €1.1 billion of investment in sustainable transport, including co-financing construction of a new 149 kilometre suburban railway network with 58 stations in Bangalore, the third largest city in India, that will reduce congestion, climate emissions and pollution. Financing for new and upgraded regional passenger trains in southwestern France and increased support for an extension of the Stockholm metro were also approved.

New clean-energy investment totalling €1.2 billion was agreed by the Board. New equity financing for investment in utility scale renewables in Asia, Latin America and Europe was approved, alongside backing small-scale wind and solar schemes in France and Germany and upgrading electricity distribution in Greece and Italy.",devdiscourse.com,news,Devdiscourse,,0.8117647058823529,452935185,1,https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/09_07_2022_13_41_01_3274143.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg,eng-9543875

Speaking to the Guardian after meeting his British counterpart, David Cameron, in London, Gabrielius Landsbergis also backed the British foreign secretary for saying that Ukraine could use British-made weapons against Russia; remarks that alongside Emmanuel Macron refusing to rule out western troops in Ukraine prompted the Kremlin to threaten UK assets and order a tactical nuclear training exercise.

Foreign secretary in Lithuania for four years, Landsbergis has long called for tougher action against Russia, but his latest remarks have shown that there is support in parts of Europe for the muscular line recently adopted by the French president.

Macron has shocked some European colleagues and infuriated Russia by saying the west should not rule out sending troops to Ukraine.

""Our troops have been training Ukrainians in Ukraine before the war, and we've been doing that for many years. So returning to this tradition might be quite doable,"" Landsbergis said. ""This could be a first step in president Macron's initiative"".

He said a proposal to train Ukrainians inside their own country was ""more practical"" than the training taking place on the territory of Nato members.

""You don't need to transport them all the way. You have everything that they need right there,"" he said. ""It could be that the trainers stationed as part of the coalition to train the Ukrainians in Ukraine could be defended with air defence, and that in turn implies that part of Ukrainian sky could be defended with air defence.""

He said the move would ""tell Putin that it's not up to him to decide the way that we're helping Ukraine. Instead, we'll see what is needed, and we adapt to the situation because the situation is not getting better.""

He said the Lithuanian parliament had already given the government a mandate to train inside Ukraine but that this would be best done as part of a bigger coalition.

Macron, facing widespread criticism, has stood his ground on the idea of sending troops to Ukraine, arguing that it is legitimate to keep Russia guessing about what the west is prepared to do to defend Ukrainian sovereignty. Strategic ambiguity unsettles Vladimir Putin, he has said.

Landsbergis said Macron's remarks had already worked since the Kremlin had changed calculations.

He said nevertheless ""there's a lot of frustration"" within Ukraine. ""The Ukrainians are making it painfully clear, especially Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister, as to what Patriot batteries are needed and how they would be used. It's impossible to make it any more clearer,"" he said.

""The damage that we're seeing - it's on us, it's our failure. It sounds like Russian success, but they can do this blindfolded if we're unable to defend Ukrainian cities. They're just bombarding the brain centres of the electricity grid which is way more difficult to fix.

""Looking into the next winter I honestly have a very difficult time to imagine how the country is going to fare.""

He said Europe's recent leadership on Ukraine had been ""a bit random"", adding that it took the Czech Republic, a relatively small country, to come up with an initiative to purchase ammunition en masse for Ukraine. ""I would love to see some of the bigger countries taking the lead in questions like air defence, tank coalition, or whatever,"" he said.

Landsbergis urged Britain to take a bigger role in Ukraine and denied that the country had taken too many steps away from Europe to make this possible. ""There is room. There is a need. There is potential and there are things that we can do together.""

He highlighted a potential role for the UK in addressing the hybrid threat posed by Russia, something he described as a new reality but not part of conventional military warfare.

""There is the possibility of kinetic hybrid activity, meaning physical attacks, arson, violence against individuals,"" he said, adding these assaults did not fall within the traditional definition of an attack to be addressed through Nato's Article 5.

""What do you do when there's a factory that is burned out or what do you do when there's an attack that is clearly funded by Russia? How are these defined and addressed?"" he asked.

You may opt out at any time.

Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Hungary on Wednesday for the third and final stop of his European tour. He began his trip on Monday in France and took a pit stop in Serbia before heading to Budapest, where he will remain until Friday.

This is the first time that the Chinese leader has visited Eastern Europe since a trip to the Czech Republic in 2016, and it demonstrates Xi's resolve to create the 16+1 group, a Chinese diplomatic initiative with former communist European countries that are investing in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Both Serbia and Hungary are BRI members.

""There are thousands of things that we can and should learn from our Chinese friends,"" Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said, calling bilateral ties an ""ironclad friendship."" Beijing is Belgrade's largest foreign investor. Serbia's Infrastructure and Energy Ministry reported this year that Chinese funding reached nearly $20 billion, and on Wednesday, the two nations announced a new free trade agreement. The deal, which will begin in July, aims to cancel tariffs on almost 95 percent of Serbia's exports to China within the next five to 10 years.

Hungary also touts strong economic ties with China. Budapest received $11.5 billion in Chinese funds in 2023 alone, much of it related to electric vehicles. Whereas the European Union has warned against China dominating the critical sector, Hungary has leaned into Chinese support. Last December, Chinese carmaker BYD announced that it would build an assembly plant in Hungary, marking its first EV production facility in Europe. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban hopes to announce more investment opportunities with Great Wall Motor, another Chinese-owned EV company, during Xi's visit this week.

Neither Serbia nor Hungary plan to mention human rights abuses in China, nor Beijing's support for Russia. The two European nations are both led by authoritarian-leaning politicians whose views largely align with China's anti-Western mindset. Hungary must maintain its ""policy of openness"" at a time when ""our most natural sales market [Western Europe] is sick,"" in Orban's words. Hungary and Serbia have repeatedly been critical of Western support for Ukraine in its war against Russia; Belgrade has balked at imposing sanctions on Moscow; and Budapest has vetoed EU sanctions against China on Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan issues.

Territorial claims also align Beijing with some of Eastern Europe. Just as China does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty, Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's independence. In turn, China supports Serbia's claims over the former territory, and Vucic has said that ""Taiwan is China -- full stop.""

Aid concerns. Israel reopened the vital Kerem Shalom crossing into southern Gaza on Wednesday. However, the United Nations said no humanitarian aid has entered thus far, a situation that a U.S. State Department spokesperson called ""just unacceptable."" Even if supplies were ready to cross, the U.N. warned that there was no one on the Gaza side to receive the aid since Palestinian workers have fled the area to escape fighting.

Israel closed Kerem Shalom over the weekend following a Hamas attack that killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. On Tuesday, Israel also took control of the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing -- prompting concern that critical aid would not be able to enter the enclave with both transit points closed. The State Department said the Rafah crossing did not open for fuel deliveries on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, fighting raged along the outskirts of Rafah on Wednesday as Israel moved ahead with its controversial ground offensive in the southern Gaza city. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed on Wednesday that Washington has paused a weapons shipment to Israel over its Rafah operation. And cease-fire negotiations remain at an impasse as talks continue in Cairo, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with U.S. CIA Director William Burns on Wednesday to discuss the potential release of hostages being held in Gaza.

EU accession on the line. North Macedonia held presidential and parliamentary elections on Wednesday, with the right-wing opposition coalition expected to win on both fronts. More than 1,700 candidates are competing for the unicameral parliament's 120 seats, while the presidential vote will decide the runoff winner of a race that began in April.

These elections could determine North Macedonia's bid to join the EU. Bulgaria remains one of the nation's biggest obstacles toward accession after blocking membership talks until North Macedonia acknowledges the country's Bulgarian minority in its constitution. Whereas the ruling Social Democratic Union has signaled its openness to the amendment, the opposition VMRO-DPMNE rejects the proposal.

Wednesday's elections ""will serve as a stark reflection of the mood within the country -- where voters are frustrated with the way European integration has progressed and eager for a much-needed overhaul of the country's many broken institutions,"" journalist Bojan Stojkovski wrote in Foreign Policy.

Massive attack. Russian forces targeted nearly a dozen energy infrastructure facilities across Ukraine on Wednesday. More than 70 missiles and drones caused serious damage at three power plants and sparked electricity cutoffs in nine regions. At least three people were injured in the Kyiv and Kirovohrad oblasts. Wednesday's attack coincided with the day that Ukraine recognizes the defeat of Nazi Germany during World War II, and it comes one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin was sworn into his record-breaking fifth term.

Moscow has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's power infrastructure to hurt public morale and damage plants that assist in military production. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Moscow has damaged nearly half of Kyiv's energy facilities, with destruction costing around $12.5 billion.

Grammarians, be warned. The North Yorkshire Council in England announced this week that it is banning apostrophes on street signs, saying the punctuation can negatively affect geographical databases.

War in Ukraine and war in Palestine. Despite being a football player and lifeguard, Biden received five draft deferments for asthma, which enabled him to escape the Vietnam war which killed 60,000 young men of his generation.

Donald Trump, his presumed rival in the November presidential race played squash and tennis, received medical deferments for alleged bone spurs.

Biden was first elected by the small state of Delaware to the US Senate in 1972, becoming the youngest senator, and was reelected every six years until 2008 when he was Barack Obama's choice for vice president. During his time in the Senate, Biden took illiberal stands on a number of issues backed by his Democrat Party. He voted against authorising the 1991 Gulf War but not because he was against the war as such but on the grounds that the US was bearing most of the burden of conducting this campaign. He supported the 2001 war in Afghanistan and the 2003 unprovoked US war on Iraq. Once the Iraq war was recognised as a disaster, he expressed regret that he had backed that war. Biden unsuccessfully ran for president in 1988 and 2008 and won in 2020. At 78, he was the oldest candidate to become president. A president who had a longstanding reputation for making political mistakes on key domestic and foreign issues and committing gaffes.

Along with Britain's ex-prime minister Boris Johnson and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, Biden was a prime motivator of the war in Ukraine. Instead of promoting a peaceful settlement between Ukraine and Russia over Kyiv's bid to join NATO, they urged Ukraine's neophyte President Volodymyr Zelensky to defy Russia's President Vladimir Putin. For Putin, this was an existential challenge which could not be ignored.

Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1989-1991, US Secretary of State James Baker promised Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev that if Moscow accepted Germany's reunification, NATO would not move ""one inch eastwards"" into countries which had belonged to the Soviet bloc. While there were no written guarantees of this pledge, reassurances were given by the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Britain's Prime Minister John Major. However, NATO has added 14 new members since 1991, prompting successive Russian presidents and senior figures to accuse NATO and the West of deceit.

In his 2007 address to the Munich Security Conference, Vladimir Putin Charged the west with breaking binding assurances. While NATO membership for Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and other countries which had been in the Warsaw Pact was uncomfortable for Moscow, NATO expansion into Ukraine amounted to a casus bello. According to Jonathan Masters writing on the US Council on Foreign Relations website in February 2023, ""Russia has deep cultural, economic and political bonds with Ukraine, and in many ways, Ukraine is central to Russia's identity and vision for itself in the world.""

The two countries were connected by close family ties, history, language, trade, agriculture and the presence in Ukraine of a million ethnic Russians. For many Russians of the older generation like Putin, Ukraine's NATO membership would alienate Russia from itself.

On the strategic territorial front, Moscow and Kyiv both claimed ownership of Russia's Crimea which Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gifted to Ukraine in 1954 to boost ties between the two peoples. However, the majority Russian residents of Crimea longed for a return to Russia while Sevastopol is Russia's main warm water port and home to the Black Sea naval fleet.

Despite US and European funds and arms, Ukraine is not winning the war. The US injection of $62 billion cannot make up for Ukraine's shortage of trained military recruits and their will to fight. The Russian front lines remain largely impenetrable and Russia has taken rather than ceded territory. Russia can simply overcome Ukrainian efforts to regain territory and wait until Kyiv is ready to talk peace on Moscow's terms. The attempt to use Ukraine as a proxy to take on Russia has failed. Ukraine and Ukrainians are paying the price.

When meeting with Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his war Cabinet at a Tel Aviv hotel after Hamas' October 7th surprise attack on Israel, Catholic Christian Biden declared, he is a Zionist. ""I don't believe you have to be a Jew to be a Zionist."" As a child, Biden's connection with Israel was forged by his father who believed Israel's creation to be just. Soon after entering the Senate in 1973, Biden met Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir who told him Israel's strength was determined by the fact that ""we have no place else to go"". Reuters cited Open Secrets Database which said that during his three decades in the Senate, Biden received $4.2 million in campaign funding from, pro-Israeli groups. While vice president, Biden mediated between Netanyahu and Obama. As president, Biden has given Netanyahu total support during his war on Gaza.

Without using US leverage to impose conditions, Biden has supplied tens of billions of dollars worth of 900 and 250 kilogramme bombs as well as artillery shells and other munitions Israel has used to kill nearly 35,000 Palestinians, wound 78,000, devastate Gaza and create a humanitarian catastrophe there. By giving Netanyahu everything he wants, Biden has sacrificed whatever influence he might use to press Israel to accept a ceasefire and prevent Israel from mounting an offensive in Rafah where 1.4 million Palestinians are sheltering in terrible conditions without food, water, electricity and sufficient medical services.

Israel's failure in seven months to eliminate Hamas has deprived Netanyahu and his sidekick Biden of the ""total victory"" they expected, alienated the Global South and some European Countries, outraged humanitarian agencies and the UN, and prompted university students in the US and across the globe to mount anti-War, anti-Israel protests. Israel and its supporters have also lost whatever moral standing they enjoyed on the world level, the International Criminal Court could issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his generals and the International Court of Justice could brand Israel's war on Gaza as ""genocide"". Nevertheless, Biden stands by Israel and could lose November's presidential election and thereafter be cited alongside Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes against humanity.",jordantimes.com,news,Jordan Times,,-0.2470588235294118,452901864,1,,eng-9542326

ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. - Imagine you wake up tomorrow and find out that you are no longer a citizen of the country you were born, and your family had lived in for generations. That was the reality Ralph Troll's mother faced on Sept. 15, 1935.

Troll's mother was Jewish, and on that fateful day, the German government, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, passed the first Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor. This law, and others that would soon follow it, were known colloquially as the Nuremberg Laws.

""As early as 1935 Hitler deprived Jews of German citizenship and other rights,"" said Dr. Ralph Troll during a talk at the Rock Island Arsenal Museum April 22. ""Jews weren't allowed to attend films or concerts, to sit on public park benches, to drive or buy newspapers.""

Troll told his story as part of U.S. Army Sustainment Command's Holocaust Days of Remembrance or Yom HaShoah observance. Yom HaShoah is observed throughout much of the world and is held on the 27th of Nisan. Nisan is a month in the Hebrew Calander, and usually falls in April or early May.

Yom HaShoah is observed in Nisan because it is the month that most of the camps were liberated by the Allied armies, and because it memorializes the start of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, which began on April 19, 1943.

This year's observance theme is, ""Behind Every Name a Story: The Courageous."" According to a memorandum issued by the Department of Defense, the theme was chosen as, ""an opportunity to recognize and reflect upon the individual suffering experienced by 6 million Jews and millions of other who endured tremendous hardship and loss.""

For Troll and his family, it took courage to live. Over the next few years life in Germany became more difficult for the Troll family.

Along with depriving Jews of their civil rights, the Nuremberg Laws also forbade marriages between Jews and gentiles. This meant that Troll's parents' marriage was illegal, as his father was Catholic. It also meant that Troll was, in the eyes of the state, only partially German. He was officially classified as a Mischling ersten Grades, or mixed race first degree. This classification prevented Ralph from fully integrating into German life.

He was allowed to attend the local elementary school but wouldn't be permitted to attend higher level schooling.

""My grades in elementary school were such, that after four years I was entitled to go to Gymnasium, or secondary school,"" said Troll. ""However, I was denied it because a half-Jew was unworthy of being educated.""

On the night of Nov. 9, 1938, elements of Nazi society, with the approval of the German government, attacked Jewish homes, business, and synagogues. Due to the damage inflicted it is remembered as Kristallnacht, or Night of Broken Glass.

""Hitler was determined to snuff out the life of all whom he deemed unworthy of life,"" said Troll. ""Anyone who did not measure up to his ideal of a pure master race.""

After that night Troll's father realized his family was no longer safe. However, it wasn't possible to leave Germany as many countries, including the U.S., had quotas on the number of Jewish refugees they would take. So, the family moved from Darmstadt to the countryside in a primitive farmhouse with five acres of land. ""We had no electricity, no running water and there was a single wood-burning stove for heating and cooking,"" said Troll. The farm kept Ralph's family alive during the war and more importantly, it kept his mother safe. ""My mom never ventured into town,"" he said.

It wouldn't be until the Gestapo showed up at their door in February 1945 to arrest his mother, that she would leave the farm. She was taken to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp, located in the present-day Czech Republic. She would be reunited with her family in June of that year. While she was, in Troll's words, a ""strong healthy woman"" when she was arrested, she weighed 90 pounds when she returned.

Troll said his mother refused to talk about her experience in the camps until almost three decades later. ""Shortly before she died, she sat me and my sister down, and said, 'Okay, I'm going to tell you this story once, and that's it.',"" said Troll.

After the war, the Troll family made plans to move to the U.S. They arrived in Chicago in January 1947 where Troll's father got a job as a chemist at the University of Chicago.

Even though the Nazis didn't believe he was worthy of an education, Troll graduated from high school and attended college where he studied biology. He taught biology for 40 years at Augustana College before retiring.

If you wish to skip our detailed discussion of the global coal market, you can go directly to the Top 5 Coal Exporting Countries in the World.

Ongoing factors like Russia-Ukraine conflict, economic growth, policy changes, and energy demand in the various regions of the world meant that global coal sector underwent continuous shift in the larger sense for the last few years; in 2022, coal saw its supply and demand both reaching its all-time high, where the demand hit the 8 billion tons mark, according to IEA. Furthermore, the demand is expected to stay the same in 2024 as well. Shifts in fuel prices, along with forward market curves are also some of the factors that are causing this trend of the market. With this, the global coal mining market is expected to rise from $648.04 billion in 2023 to hit $795.76 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 2.6%, according to Expert Market Research. The demand for coal is expected to continue to exist and drive the market, despite the recent shift to renewables. If this prediction is accurate, this may be a great opportunity to buy coal stocks (see 11 Best Coal Stocks to Buy)

As far as coal mines are concerned, 3 biggest coal mines of the world are North Antelope Rochelle coal mine, Haerwusu coal mine, and Hei Dai Gou coal mine, with coal recoverable reserve totaling 1.7 billion tons, 1.6 billion tons, and 1.5 billion tons, respectively.

With a record 505.4 million tons exported in 2023, an increase of 54 million tons, or 12%, over 2022, Indonesia emerged as the world's largest exporter of thermal coal, according to Reuters. While Indonesia may top as the global exporter, China, with a 2.5% increase in production to 3,942 million tons in 2021, remains the world's largest producer of coal, according to Global Data. Additionally, China, on its own, is responsible for one-third of the coal consumption on global level, according to S&P Global. While 120 countries don't export any coal, among those that do, the one at the bottom of the list is Sweden, exporting only 10 short tons of coal in 2021.

On the other hand, there have been some notable recent developments in the US coal market. The United States produced 140.8 million short tons of coal in the fourth quarter of 2023, a 3.4% decline from the same time in 2022, according to S&P Global. This production has been predicted to see a downtick in coming years, as S&P Global sees 19% fall in 2024, and another 3% in 2025. The consumption of coal is expected to follow this downward trend in the U.S., as well as European regions, as renewable sources of energy are expected to satisfy 90% of any electricity demand by 2025, according to IEA. As the coal market has allocated the concentration of production onto metallurgical coal for industrial consumption, as well as for exports purposes, the industry looks onto stabilization. During this time, however, employment in U.S. coal mines remained relatively steady despite the drop in production, increasing by less than 1% annually on average. You can see the biggest coal mining companies in the US here.

In the realm of coal mining and production, two industry giants are going to be discussed, namely, Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) and Arch Resources, Inc. (NYSE:ARCH).

Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) operates coal mining works across the regions of United States, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, India, Brazil, Belgium, Chile, France, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, South Korea, Germany, and more. The company, headquartered in Saint Louis, Missouri, boasted net income figure of whopping $760 million in 2023, with its operating cash flows from continued operations hitting the $1.1 billion mark! Furthermore, with the purpose of giving back to its shareholders, Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) announced $471 million return for them in 2024!

Arch Resources, Inc. (NYSE:ARCH), on the other hand, operates across America, boasting a substantial control in the market, by taking over and controlling coal reserves with the help of long-term leases; these coal lands span across the states of Ohio, Maryland, and Virginia, to name a few. They target the utility, industrial and steel production markets on the domestic, as well as an international scale.

Moving on to the financial performance of Arch Resources, Inc. (NYSE:ARCH), we find that the company's net income of 2023 4 quarter, ending 31 December 2023, stood at $114.9 million, which meant an EPS of $6.07; however, it was a decrease from the prior year's net income figure of $470.5 million, and EPS of $23.18. Also, the company's revenue figure was $774 million for the year, which was a decrease from the prior year's revenue of $859.5 million.

Having discussed the overall situation of the global coal market, we will now move forward to our list of Top 20 Coal Exporting Countries in the World.

The Board of Directors of the European Investment Bank (EIB) today approved an updated definition of dual-use goods and infrastructure eligible for EIB Group financing and agreed to facilitate financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the security and defence industry, by opening up dedicated intermediated financing.

The Board also approved €4.5 billion in new financing for projects, including in the strategic priority areas of climate action, technological innovation and agriculture.

""We are stepping up our support for Europe's security and defence industry, strengthening investment to keep Europe and its citizens safe, while safeguarding the EIB Group's financing capacity,"" EIB President Nadia Calviño said.

Revamped rules for security and defence financing

Boosting EIB Group support to safeguard Europe's peace and security is one of the top strategic priorities, outlined by President Calviño to EU Finance Ministers in February. Following intensive consultations with the Bank's shareholders, financial markets and key stakeholders, and the European Council's mandate to further improve access to finance for European security and defence firms, President Calviño unveiled an immediate Security and Defence Industry Action Plan at the last EU Finance Ministers meeting (ECOFIN), where the initiative received broad support.

Today's Board of Directors meeting formally adopted the Action Plan. Going forward, the EIB will waive a previous requirement that dual-use projects eligible for financing in the area of security and defence derive more than 50% of their expected revenues from civilian use. Projects and infrastructure used by the military or police that also serve civilian needs will now be eligible for EIB Group financing. There will no longer be a minimum threshold for expected revenues from civilian applications or share of civilian users.

The EIB Group will also update its rules for security and defence SME financing. This will open dedicated credit lines managed by banks in EU Member States and other intermediaries for dual-use projects by smaller companies and innovative startups. EU companies whose activity is partly in defence will be eligible for financing using EIB-backed intermediated credit lines. No further changes were made to the EIB Group's eligibility, excluded activities and excluded sectors list.

The EIB Group has created a dedicated Security and Defence Office, providing a one-stop shop for security and defence investment, operational since 1 May 2024. It offers streamlined financial support and expert assistance aimed at strengthening Europe's security and defence capabilities.

The changes are expected to speed up investment and improve access to EIB Group financing for the European security and defence sector, deploying €6 billion in funding available under the Strategic European Security Initiative (SESI), and the European Investment Fund's (EIF) Defence Equity Facility, and further boosting the EIB Group's already considerable support to the European security and defence industry.

€4.5 billion for innovation, business, transport and agriculture investment

The Board today also approved €4.5 billion of new financing for renewable energy, agriculture, sustainable transport and business investment.

""The financing will have an impact in creating skilled jobs, increasing renewable energy generation and enhancing sustainable transport infrastructure to improve lives and opportunities and to contribute to a greener and more resilient future for all,"" said EIB President Nadia Calviño.

The Board approved €1 billion of new business financing. Sustainability-focused corporate research and innovation across Europe will be supported by a dedicated pan-European venture debt initiative and new cooperation with local financing partners to scale up business financing in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Armenia and Azerbaijan, while access to finance to enable companies to expand and create jobs will be enhanced by new business financing programmes with banking partners in Spain and the Czech Republic. The first financing programme for agribusiness and agricultural cooperatives in Senegal, under the EIB's pan-African agriculture financing initiative, and support for agricultural and rural development investment in Spain were also approved.

The EIB backed €1.1 billion of investment in sustainable transport, including co-financing construction of a new 149 kilometre suburban railway network with 58 stations in Bangalore, the third largest city in India, that will reduce congestion, climate emissions and pollution. Financing for new and upgraded regional passenger trains in southwestern France and increased support for an extension of the Stockholm metro were also approved.

New clean-energy investment totalling €1.2 billion was agreed by the Board. New equity financing for investment in utility scale renewables in Asia, Latin America and Europe was approved, alongside backing small-scale wind and solar schemes in France and Germany and upgrading electricity distribution in Greece and Italy.

Background information

The European Investment Bank (ElB) is the long-term lending institution of the European Union, owned by its Member States. It finances sound investments that contribute to EU policy objectives. EIB projects bolster competitiveness, drive innovation, promote sustainable development, enhance social and territorial cohesion, and support a just and swift transition to climate neutrality.

The EIB Group, which also includes the European Investment Fund (EIF), signed a total of €88 billion in new financing for over 900 projects in 2023. These commitments are expected to mobilise around €320 billion in investment, supporting 400,000 companies and 5.4 million jobs.

All projects financed by the EIB Group are in line with the Paris Climate Accord. The EIB Group does not fund investments in fossil-fuels. We are on track to deliver on our commitment to support €1 trillion in climate and environmental sustainability investment in the decade to 2030 as pledged in our Climate Bank Roadmap. Over half of the EIB Group's annual financing supports projects directly contributing to climate change mitigation, adaptation, and a healthier environment.

Approximately half of the EIB's financing within the EU is directed towards cohesion regions, where per capita income is lower. This underscores the Bank's commitment to fostering inclusive growth and the convergence of living standards.

The EIB Group has been actively supporting investment that reinforces Europe's defence and security industry since 2017. Beneficiaries of EIB Group financing range from household names in the defence sector to innovative startups.

Under its Strategic European Security Initiative (SESI), expanded immediately after Russia's aggression against Ukraine, there still is €6 billion in funding available. In addition, the EIF launched a €175 million Defence Equity Facility in January 2024, which can support SME and start-ups in the field, such as those in the area cybersecurity.

Eligible projects under SESI will include military mobility, space, cybersecurity, green security, critical infrastructure, border protection, and other dual-use investments, such as drones.

A team of 28 performers from Arkins Dance Company, based in the north inner city, was chosen to represent Ireland at the competition in Prague.

However, according to Alysia Arkins, who runs the academy, high travel costs totalling just under €60,000 euro initially threatened to scupper their hopes of competing at all.

""When we got the call to say we had made the Ireland team, we just assumed we'd be able to pay it out. Then we found out the price. So, the accommodation was over €36,000, that's a lot of money,"" she said.

Ms Arkins added: ""The flights were over €11,000 and then the uniforms were €5,000 alone. And then the entries, just to get into the competition, was €6,000. So it worked out a lot of money.""

However, after creating an online fundraising page to help lighten the financial load, the academy began seeing hundreds of donations pour in.

Speaking to RTÉ News, a ""grateful"" Ms Arkins thanked the people of Ireland for ""getting behind us"", during a time when the dance academy's fees were often not enough to cover their electricity bill.

""I was just overjoyed for them (the children) because I knew it's their dream and I didn't want the price to get in the way.

""I knew that they were going to experience this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that the people had given them that chance now that we thought was out of reach,"" she said.

Arkins Dance Academy was founded by Ms Arkins' mother Francesca 29 years ago, and now provides a creative outlet for over 100 children in the north inner city.

Owner and choreographer Alysia Arkins believes the academy can act as an escape for her students who live in the local community.

""The streets are not safe for them to go out and play anymore the way they used to be. No matter what you read or what's going on outside it's always joy in here, it's always happiness,"" Ms Arkins said.

""It's peace of mind for their parents as well that they're actually getting a childhood, they actually have somewhere to come. Every day they're being told what to do, they come in here, this is what they want to do, this is where they have fun,"" she added.

For South Korea, it is difficult to come up with such direct support programs, but the government is working to create an environment to benefit long-term investment in the sector, Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun said in a press briefing Tuesday.

Ahn also explained that the ministry, along with other government entities will set up a public fund to support strategic industries, including semiconductors.

""It is difficult to come up with a direct subsidy program. Giving out subsidies (for one industry) is risky, and lawmakers also face similar difficulties at the National Assembly,"" Ahn said.

""Instead of offering loans, we seek to create an environment favorable for long-term investment. We are currently in discussions with related government entities including the Finance Ministry to set up a fund to foster advanced technologies including chips, secondary batteries, biopharmaceuticals and displays.

Chip subsidy programs are widespread among chip powerhouses, but Korea, home to the world's two largest memory chipmakers Samsung Electronics and SK hynix, faces opposition that it is unfair to offer large subsidies to one single industry.

Instead of providing direct funding, government support in Korea leans more towards granting permits for smooth operation and loosening regulations, the official explained.

During the press briefing, the industry minister underscored that trade is the answer to boost the country's stagnant growth rate, and said he will work to achieve the goal of $700 billion in exports this year.

""One of the reasons behind our push to increase export was because we could not find other driving factors to boost the economic growth in the domestic economy,"" Ahn said.

""Our goal is to raise the growth rate by 0.5 percentage point to achieve growth in the late-2 percent, and personally, 3 percent."" South Korea's economy has been predicted to grow 2.3 percent by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development this year.

""The president said he will become Korea's No. 1 salesman (for boosting trade). I will be Korea's No. 1 helmsman (in support),"" Ahn said, adding that the ministry will announce the country's trade strategy soon.

He also highlighted the importance of adopting artificial intelligence technology to maintain the manufacturing industry, which is the pillar of the country's economy.

The Industry Ministry on Wednesday announced the country's ""AI autonomous manufacturing strategy 1.0,"" aimed at introducing AI-based robots and equipment in manufacturing processes. The ministry said it will invest about 1 trillion won ($733 million) over the next five years together with private companies, to increase the AI manufacturing system expansion rate from the current 9 percent to over 30 percent by 2030.

Regarding Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power's bid for a project to construct four nuclear reactors in the Czech Republic, Ahn said South Korea currently holds a competitive edge against France's EDF, for its proven capability. The country has completed the construction of nuclear reactors in the United Arab Emirates.

A final decision is expected to be made around June and July.

Ahn also stressed the need to promote the use of carbon-free renewable sources and nuclear energy amid the growing electricity demand.

""As we cannot fully power cutting-edge industries with renewable sources alone, the country must supplement the supply with nuclear energy,"" Ahn said. ""The government aims to promote a balanced use of both renewable sources and nuclear energy.""

The ministry will soon unveil its long-term plan for the energy portfolio, including plans to construct new nuclear plants, later this month.

On the financial challenges the state-run utility companies, Korea Electric Power Corp. and Korea Gas Corp., face, Ahn said the government is ""weighing the appropriate timing,"" to raise utility prices, including gas and electricity soon.

""As the situations in the Middle East remain unstable, we are monitoring the situation while finding the appropriate timing to raise electricity and gas prices,"" the minister said.",koreaherald.com,news,The Korea Herald,Jo He-rim,0.1843137254901961,452853504,7,https://res.heraldm.com/content/image/2024/05/08/20240508050724_0.jpg?1,

Yonhap

By Lee Min-hyung

Korea is the most qualified bidder to build a nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic as Asia's fourth-largest economy boasts unmatched construction prowess particularly in energy-related infrastructure projects, Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Ahn Duk-geun said Tuesday.

The country is making its last-minute efforts to promote Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power's (KHNP) bid for the mega-sized order worth 30 trillion won ($21.97 billion) from the nation in Central and Eastern Europe. The state-run KHNP intensifies its two-way rivalry against France's EDF. The final decision will be made sometime in July.

""We have secured strong construction capabilities in nuclear power plants, and we are the only nation that can complete the project under the deadline,"" Ahn told reporters.

""Many firms of other countries ended up missing the construction deadline in their nuclear power plant projects, but Korea's engineering firms have experiences of completing the construction of four nuclear reactors on time in the United Arab Emirates (UAE),"" he said.

The minister also expressed confidence of the KHNP winning the upcoming project, saying only Korea is capable of handling thousands of personnel dispatched for the construction of four nuclear reactors there.

""More than 100 companies in Korea have experiences of employing around 14,000 laborers and managing industrial infrastructure in the Czech Republic,"" Ahn said. ""It requires thousands of laborers to construct four nuclear reactors, and Korea is the only nation realistically capable of managing such a huge workforce.""

If KHNP is selected as the preferred bidder for the project, it will mark the first time in 15 years for Korea to achieve a similar outcome since a consortium -- led by Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) -- succeeded in building the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant in the UAE in 2009.

""Korea may have a disadvantage due to geopolitical reasons, as France is a European nation, but we will do our very best to the end,"" he said.

Last week, Ivan Jancarek, the Czech Republic's ambassador to South Korea, visited a nuclear power plant in the nation's southeastern city of Ulsan, and took a look at the overall operation of the facility. He is expected to have shared details with the relevant authorities in his home country.

Regarding any timeline for the next electricity price hike, the industry minister said the proper timing is still being considered amid lingering inflationary pressure and geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East. The government has frozen the price of electricity since the third quarter of last year. The gas price also has also remained static since May 2023.

""Hiking the prices of electricity and gas is urgent, but we are concerned that the move will deal a severe blow to the industry and the people's livelihoods,"" Ahn said. ""We are also closely monitoring the external instability, and will figure out the appropriate timing to do so.""",koreatimes.co.kr,news,The Korea Times,,0.3411764705882352,452848099,14,https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/5959d6289c7f4633ab0ec9ef86deb2d8.png,

""As the situations in the Middle East remain unstable, we are monitoring the situation while finding the appropriate timing to raise electricity and gas prices,"" Ahn said during a meeting with reporters on Tuesday.

""We must normalize electricity and gas prices, and the issue is urgent,"" Ahn added, noting that the government is also mindful of the burden on the people.

""As the hike would give a direct hit on consumers' livelihood, with industries also expressing concerns, we need to seek an overall balance,"" the minister said.

State-run utility companies, including Korea Electric Power Corp. and Korea Gas Corp., have faced financial challenges due to the prolonged war between Russia and Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions, as they have been unable to sufficiently raise prices to cover the increased cost of energy sources.

Ahn also stressed the need to promote the use of carbon-free renewable sources and nuclear energy amid the growing electricity demand.

""As we cannot fully power cutting-edge industries with renewable sources alone, the country must supplement the supply with nuclear energy,"" Ahn said. ""The government aims to promote a balanced use of both renewable sources and nuclear energy.""

The minister said that the government will unveil its long-term vision for the energy portfolio, including plans to construct new nuclear plants, later this month.

Touching on Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power's bid for a project to construct four nuclear reactors in the Czech Republic, Ahn said South Korea has an advantage in its capability to complete construction projects on time.

The Czech government earlier invited bids for its nuclear plant projects from the KHNP and France's EDF, with a final decision expected to be made around June and July.

""While South Korea may have a disadvantage in terms of politics and diplomacy as France is a European nation, we intend to spare no efforts until the end,"" Ahn said.

In supporting cutting-edge industries such as the semiconductor sector, Ahn said that it would be more beneficial for the government to establish a comprehensive fund to support the sector, rather than providing direct subsidies.

""We plan to create a comprehensive fund to foster strategic industries, encompassing not only semiconductors but also batteries, biotechnology, and display technologies,"" the minister added.

The EU's climate agenda is in trouble. The Green Deal, which aims to slash the bloc's carbon emissions by 55% by 2030, had started off promisingly after several major pieces of legislation were adopted, including its ban on the sale of new combustion-powered vehicles from 2035 and carbon border tax. Increasingly, however, Europeans are rebelling against green restrictions of which they have difficulty seeing the advantages.

The elephants in the room

Another less reported upon but equally important threat to the bloc's ecological and energy transition comes from the alarming number of Chinese and US companies moving into the EU power sector.

In our book, Energy: How to Recover Our European Ambition (published in French), we shed light on this overlooked issue ahead of European elections that will be critical for the EU's energy strategy and call on the bloc to carefully weigh up cooperation and competition with sovereignty.

China eyes Europe's energy sector

While there currently isn't any quantitative data on China's share in the European energy market, we do know the country detains 80% of the global clean-technology manufacturing capacity in 11 segments, from solar wafers to many lithium-ion battery components.

Taking advantage of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, Chinese investors first stepped in to acquire substantial stakes in what have long been regarded as ""sovereign"" sectors, such as power transmission and distribution grids, in the early 2010s. Key among those was the world's largest utility company, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), commonly known as the State Grid - the world's fourth-biggest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart, Saudi Aramco and Amazon as of March. Also increasingly present is Three Gorges Corp, responsible for the world's largest hydroelectric power complex.

For instance, in Portugal, Three Gorges Corp. won the bidding for the Portuguese government's 21% stake in EDP-Energias de Portugal SA in 2010. Meanwhile, in Italy, SGCC expanded its presence by collaborating with the Italian government in 2014, acquiring a 35% share in the CDP Reti fund, thereby attaining a blocking minority at the local gas network operator, SNAM, and electricity transmission network operator, Terna. Similarly, in Greece the State Grid made substantial inroads by acquiring a 24% stake in the national electricity transmission network operator from the Greek government in 2016.

While Portugal, Italy, and Greece were primary targets, Chinese investors have also acquired grids in Luxembourg. Last but not least, let's not forget China's green-tech industry has flooded Europe with cheap solar panels and electric vehicles (EVs).

US inroads in the EU energy market

The stakes are all the higher because China is not the only country with ambitions in the EU. The United States is also seeking to benefit from the bloc's poorly thought-out energy strategy.

Russia's war against Ukraine has not weakened the United States' energy dominance in the world, and more specifically in the EU. Indeed, while Russian gas was expected to act as a bridge fuel in the energy transition, particularly for Germany, the EU was quick to adopt sanctions against its long-term trade partner that minimised its dependence. Partly filling the vacant space left by Moscow, the United States has become the leading producer and exporter of LNG to Europe. This development favours US trade while domestic energy costs are kept low, further widening the price gap, with Europe experiencing an energy inflation and undermining its relative competitiveness and attractiveness to energy-intensive industry.

Beyond these energy-supply issues, EU member states are struggling to carve out a common vision, highlighting the challenges of sovereignty and strategic autonomy. European companies, particularly in France, have endeavoured to develop fourth-generation small modular nuclear reactors (SMR), with an attempt to create a European nuclear alliance made in November 2023. But at the same moment, countries such as Italy, Belgium, and Romania have partnered with the American Westinghouse Electric Company to develop lead-cooled fast reactors.

Here again, the coordination gap plays to the advantage of American influence in Europe, as confirmed by John Kerry in September 2023. As part of the international consortium ""Clean Fuel from SMR"", led by American companies, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland were selected to participate and will receive support for coal-to-SMR feasibility studies. These EU countries are turning to the Americans to build new nuclear power plants, mainly because of their funding and technical expertise, while the EU continues to block all support for nuclear projects developed on its soil.

Cracks in the EU's net-zero goals

The scale of these foreign investments in renewable energies, new nuclear facilities and grid development could come to bear heavily onto the bloc's strategic independence at a time when it's looking to decarbonise.

These investments raise concerns over continental energy security, given the still fragmented nature of Europe's energy landscape:

in the short run, supply issues due to the energy crisis urgently push the EU to turn to other foreign partners (other than Russia) and only shift our energy dependence problem;

in the longer term, faced with Chinese dumping and US protectionism, Europe will have to protect domestic energy manufacturers or grid operators after having long neglected them.

The main challenge for Europe is ending one dependency without falling into another. To replace imports of fossil fuels (coal, gas, and oil), harmful to the climate, the EU member states must accelerate and coordinate the development of their ""green"" technologies.

Toward green sovereignty

These risks demand that the bloc not only pays more attention to non-EU operators, but take greater responsibility over its own energy system. How can it do this, all while pursuing the vision of the ""green, secure and affordable energy supply"" set out in its Green Deal?

For starters, we recommend EU member states work harder on building truly European energy grids. As we move toward decarbonisation, we can expect an array of renewable energies to increasingly power our electricity system. These arrangements will require extensive and interconnected networks on a European scale, which must be consolidated and developed by the EU member states themselves.

A second emergency is green energy financing. In November, the European Climate Neutrality Observatory warned a lack of EU-level public investment in green energy and other advances could lead the bloc to fail to meet its net-zero goals. Rather than take heed of the warning, member states axed the fund earmarked for renewables and clean tech - the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) - to 1.5bn in February. Our book calls for a radical change of strategy, through the creation of a ""European transition savings account"" to attract private savings, on the one hand, and a ""European sovereign fund"" that receives proceeds from carbon-pricing revenues on the other.

Whether these actually come into being will depend on the upcoming European elections. Results leaning toward a higher European ambition could help us seen in clean, affordable and secure solutions. Further veering to the nationalistic right could further jeopardise the bloc's economic clout and, paradoxically, sovereignty.

It was created by two non-governmental organizations: Human Capital Center in Ukraine (Kyiv) and Institute for Global Transformation (Brussels). The purpose of the platform is to develop mechanisms for mutually beneficial cooperation between the EU and Ukraine that would contribute to joint economic growth.

The event was supported by the Mission of Ukraine to the European Union. More than 50 guests joined the event. The event was opened by Ambassador Vsevolod Chentsov, Head of the Mission of Ukraine to the EU.

Among the guests were representatives of 18 countries, including members of the diplomatic missions of Austria, Ireland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Moldova, Georgia, Japan, Turkey, Canada, Romania and Croatia. The event was also attended by representatives of international financial institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Business Association, the Brussels Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BECI).

During UAFP's presentation in Brussels, potential cooperation between Ukraine and the EU at the diplomatic level, in the business sphere, and in the field of investment was discussed.

Lana Zerkal, a representative of the UAFP Steering Committee and a well-known diplomat, emphasized that the platform aims to facilitate a dialogue between Ukrainian businesses, Ukrainian local authorities, and European businesses. It is high-quality communication that will allow each of the parties to maximize the benefits of Ukraine's European integration.

""We understand that it is very important for regional authorities and regional elites to build relationships and be heard not only at the level of the Ukrainian government, but also to consider development strategies, to understand where they will be in 5-10 years, how European integration will change their lives and what opportunities they can take advantage of now. That is why we are joining our efforts and hope that together with others we will be able to empower and increase the ability of our economic agents to communicate, because indeed, communication is one of the key goals of this platform,"" Zerkal said.

Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, Chairman of the Board of the National Energy Company Ukrenergo, explained how Ukraine can help Europe with an additional source of energy as the demand for electricity in Europe grows. Despite Russia's destruction of its energy infrastructure, Ukraine still has the opportunity to increase electricity exports to the EU.

""We are not an energy system that just needs help. We are an energy system that can help Europe, and we can fit very well into the European strategy of energy autonomy in the future. But for that, we need to make sure that the transformation of the energy sector is happening inside Ukraine. And when we talk about the energy transformation of Ukraine, we are talking about making Ukraine the first large climate-neutral system on the continent, and maybe even in the world,"" Kudrytsky said.

In March and April, UAFP will focus on organizing coordination meetings with representatives of Ukrainian business associations and industry.

In top national news: As polling in Phase 3 of the Lok Sabha election kicked off at 7 am today, over 11 crore people across 93 constituencies in 11 states and Union Territories (UTs) are expected to cast their votes to elect a new government. At the end of Phase 3, over 280 out of 543 constituencies will have their fates sealed. The election results will be announced on June 4. Five states - Assam, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat and Karnataka -- will wrap up their polling in Phase 3. Former Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa and his sons cast their votes in Shivamogga early morning.

The Election Commission (EC) is likely to ask X (formerly Twitter) to take down an animation video posted by the BJP's Karnataka unit on May 4, that seeks to underline the party's allegation of Muslim appeasement by the Congress, The Indian Express has learnt. The Congress had filed a complaint with the state chief electoral officer on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Congress is learnt to have submitted its response to the EC's notice sent to party chief Mallikarjun Kharge on April 25, for alleged violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) by star campaigner Rahul Gandhi.

Meanwhile, Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena Monday recommended a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for allegedly receiving political funding for the AAP from the banned extremist organisation Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). The AAP hit back, calling it a ""conspiracy"" and Saxena an ""agent"" of the BJP ""which is in panic"" because ""it is losing all seven seats in Delhi"". Acting on a complaint from Ashoo Mongia of the World Hindu Federation, Saxena wrote to the Union Home Secretary, seeking an NIA probe, a day before the Supreme Court is scheduled to consider granting interim bail to Kejriwal given the ongoing Lok Sabha elections.

The highest court of the Czech Republic has stayed the lower courts' decisions permitting the extradition of Indian national Nikhil Gupta -- indicted by the United States for plotting to kill Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun -- citing no significant harm to the public interest if this action is delayed, The Indian Express has learnt. In its interim decision dated January 30, 2024, the Constitutional Court in Prague said Gupta's extradition to the US for criminal prosecution would result in disproportionately greater harm to him than anyone else. Further, it emphasised that this action would be irreversible, even if it upholds Gupta's challenge.

In top international news: Unused European Union funds meant for helping member states recover from the pandemic should be put towards building the defence industry, Poland's deputy prime minister and its foreign minister said on Monday. Poland is spending more on defence as a proportion of its GDP than other EU states and has called for EU members to ramp up defence spending in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""All unused national recovery plan funds should be shifted towards defence projects,"" deputy Prime minister and defence minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak Kamysz said during a panel at the Defence24 conference in Warsaw.

A Russian drone attack cut power to more than 400,000 consumers in parts of Ukraine's northeast region of Sumy, officials said on Monday, after Kyiv said its air defence forces downed 12 attack drones in the region overnight. Work to restore electricity continued into the morning as 91 settlements out of the 1,325 impacted remained without power in the region, national grid operator Ukrenergo said on the Telegram messaging app. ""Electricity supply has been restored in the affected settlements and parts of the city of Sumy,"" the region's military administration said on Telegram.

Russia plans to hold drills simulating the use of tactical nuclear weapons, the Defense Ministry announced Monday, days after the Kremlin reacted angrily to comments by senior Western officials about the war in Ukraine. The drills are in response to ""provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,"" the Defense Ministry said in a statement. It was the first time that Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, though its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises. Tactical nuclear weapons have a lower yield compared to massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles intended to obliterate entire cities.

The European Commission has cleared under state aid rules the Czech Republic's financial backing for a 1,200-megawatt nuclear power plant being developed by the country's majority state-owned utility CEZ Group.

Planned for trial operation 2036 and commercial startup 2038, Dukovany 2 will replace part of the existing Dukovany 1 nuclear plant's capacity of about 15 terawatt hours a year. Dukovany 1 is the Czech Republic's first nuclear power plant, commissioned 1985, according to CEZ.

""Czechia plans to grant direct price support in the form of a power purchasing contract with a State-owned Special Purpose Vehicle"", the Commission said in a statement announcing the approval. ""The contract will ensure stable revenues for the nuclear power plant for a period of 40 years.

""The beneficiary will also benefit of a subsidized State loan to cover a majority of the construction costs and a protection mechanism against unforeseen events or policy changes that may make the realization of the project impossible"".

The clearance was granted after Czechia addressed concerns by the Commission, the European Union's executive arm.

""To ensure that the aid is proportionate and does not unduly distort the functioning of the electricity market, Czechia introduced a remuneration formula akin to a two-way contract-for-difference, which provides revenue stability and limits excess remuneration through a yearly ex-post settlement"", the Commission said.

""In principle, when average electricity prices are low, the plant receives a top-up equal to the difference between the strike price and the reference price (an ex-post yearly average of hourly market prices) for a given reference quantity.

""When average electricity prices are high, the plant pays back the difference between reference price and strike price. In addition, for every megawatt-hour of electricity produced, the plant receives the actual market price, thus exposing the plant to market signals for efficient and flexible operation.

""In particular, market prices provide incentives to reduce production and plan maintenance and refueling when market prices are low and to increase production when market prices are high.

""Such exposure to market signals limits market distortions and prevents the displacement of renewables, to the benefits of the electricity system and facilitating its decarbonization"".

Czechia also cut the duration of the direct price support from 60 years to 40 years, as well as based the strike price on a discounted cash flow model, ""ensuring that the total aid amount, taking into account the subsidized loan, is limited to the funding gap of the project"".

""To address the risk of overcompensation, Czechia will implement a claw-back mechanism. It will ensure that any additional gains generated by the project will be shared with the Czech State"", the Commission added.

The new nuclear plant project cleared an Environment Impact Assessment 2019 and in 2021 received a siting permit and a Generating Plant Authorization. Meanwhile the zoning procedure is underway, having been submitted 2021, according to CEZ.

Last November the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said a mission it had sent to the country ""established a solid basis for the safe and responsible management of radioactive waste and spent fuel"".

""After storage in pools for seven to ten years, spent fuel is kept in dry storage facilities at the NPP [nuclear power plant] sites"", the United Nations nuclear watchdog said in a report November 1, referring to the Central European nation's six nuclear power generation sites in Dukovany and Temelin. ""A shallow land repository for low-level radioactive waste from both NPPs is located at the Dukovany NPP site.

""The Government plans to commission a deep geological repository for spent fuel and shortlisted four possible sites in 2020"".

But the IAEA told the government to ""consider undertaking a review of the potential impact of radioactive waste and spent fuel from additional nuclear power reactors which could be included in a future State Energy Policy"", said the report on the agency's website.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.3568627450980393,452712665,20,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/New-Czechia-Nuclear-Plant-to-Receive-State-Aid-176639-582x327.webp,

Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power (KHNP), ARC Clean Technology (ARC), and New Brunswick Power (NB Power) this week signed a trilateral Collaboration Agreement to further cooperation between the three parties.

It has the goal of establishing teaming agreements for global SMR fleet deployment. The Collaboration Agreement was signed at the Reuters SMR and Advanced Reactor 2024 Conference in Atlanta, Georgia.

South Korea has several separate efforts underway to develop SMRs using light water reactors design principles. This is the first time a South Korean firm has committed to co-develop an advanced SMR design with the objective of building a fleet of them on a global basis.

Southeast Asian countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore have all indicated interest in SMRs as being more affordable that full size 1,000 MW+ light water reactors. In particular the megacities of Southeast Asia are hungry for carbon emission free power to support their growth.

Scope of the Agreement and Capabilities of the Partners

The three-party agreement establishes firm commitments to deliverables, processes, and timelines to advance discussions for participation and potential investment in the deployment of ARC units, starting with the commercial demonstration unit in the Province of New Brunswick. The three companies bring significant capabilities in the technical design, operation, and construction of nuclear facilities.

KHNP is the largest electric power company in Korea and one of the world's largest nuclear operators. The company has acquired world-class capabilities in the construction and operation of nuclear power plants globally.

ARC is developing the ARC-100, a versatile Generation IV advanced sodium-cooled fast reactor suitable for on-grid and industrial applications. The first deployment of the ARC reactor is an on-grid commercial demonstration unit serving NB Power, one of Canada's three nuclear operators, at the site of the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station. In 2023, NB Power's license to prepare site application for the ARC-100 was the first application submitted by a nuclear operator for a Generation IV advanced reactor.

The ARC-100 is a 100 MWe sodium cooled, fast flux, pool type reactor with metallic fuel that is based on the 30 year successful operation of the EBR-II reactor in Idaho. ARC was formed to bring back and commercialize a technically mature, advanced reactor technology that was created and proven by a U.S. prototype reactor that ran successfully in the United States for 30 years which is the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) which was developed at the Argonne West field station on the Arco Desert 27 miles west of Idaho Falls, ID.

ARC has made significant proprietary advances to the original EBR-II design in order to create the ARC-100.

The ARC-100 design creates a ""walk away"" passive safety system that insures the reactor will never melt down even in a disaster that causes a complete loss of power to the plant site. In addition, it can be fueled with the nuclear waste produced by traditional reactors, and its 20 year refueling cycle offers new levels of proliferation resistance.

The company has a goal of deploying the first unit at the Point LePreau site by 2030.

Regulatory Status of the ARC-100

In February 2022 the ARC-100 entered Phase 2 of Vendor Design Review at the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is currently engaged in pre-application activities interactions with ARC Clean Technology (ARC) for the ARC-100 Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor. The firm's Regulatory Engagement Plan was filed with the NRC in April 2023 ML23120A001 It contains a proposed schedule for submittal of the white papers and technical and topical reports identified as of that date.

(NucNet) Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) has submitted a binding offer for the construction of new nuclear units in the Czech Republic. The South Korean state company said on social media that in addition to a planned fifth unit at the Dukovany nuclear site, the offer includes binding options for three additional units -Dukovany-5 and Temelín-3 and Temelín-4. KHNP said its offer was for the APR1000 reactor technology, which has an output of 1,050 MW and has already been certified in Europe.

""The plant has been designed by KHNP specifically for export to European countries and has been localized to meet European conditions and comply with requirements based on the latest International Atomic Energy Agency and Western European Nuclear Regulators Association standards,"" KHNP said in a press statement.

The firm said it said it has been developing relationships with the Czech government, universities and potential suppliers.

""Cooperation with Czech companies is a long-term priority for KHNP,"" the the firm said adding, ""Since 2016, KHNP has identified over 200 potential Czech suppliers and signed more than 50 memorandums of understanding as a basis for future cooperation.""

KHNP said it is the only bidder counting on a Czech company for the delivery of the turbine, which is one of the most important and largest components in a nuclear power plant.

The offer from KHNP was announced as France's state energy company EDF submitted an updated offer for the delivery of up to four new nuclear power units in the Czech Republic. The EDF offer is for up to four EPR1200 reactors at the Dukovany site - Units 5 and 6 - and at the Temelín site - Units 3 and 4.

Details Of New Build Plans Remain Unclear

Exactly how many new nuclear plants the Czech government is planning to build, and at which sites, remains unclear. Also unclear is how the Czech government plans to finance the massive new build. A decade ago the government walked away from a similar new build worth$25 billion at the time .

The government had previously been looking for binding bids for a single new 1,200-MW Dukovany unit with the possibility for non-binding offers for an additional three units split between the Dukovany and Temelín nuclear stations. EDF and KHNP are both proposing two units at each site.

Dukovany is about 50 km west of Brno in the south of the country and Temelín more than 100 km south of Prague in the southwest.

Czech prime-minister Petr Fiala told journalists earlier this year that building up to four new reactor units ""in one package"" is economically advantageous and estimated to push the total cost down by 25%. The government set an ambitious agenda of deciding on the winner and the size of the contract by the end of 2024.

(NucNet) A US Court of Appeals has has denied a challenge to a license renewal application extension granted by the federal government for the two-unit Diablo Canyon nuclear power station in California.

In an opinion written by US circuit judge Consuelo Callahan, the three-judge panel found that the NRC had not acted arbitrarily nor capriciously. The agency ""adequately explained why California's changing energy needs constitute a special circumstance, and why the record supported its findings of no undue risk to the public health and safety.""

The 36-page decision written by US circuit judge Consuelo Callahan, said;

""We conclude that NRC's issuance of the NEPA categorical exclusion is supported by the record. Despite Petitioners' arguments to the contrary, there is nothing in the language of the categorical exclusion that limits its use to certain types of exemptions. Additionally, NRC historically has approved timely renewal exemption requests using the very same NEPA categorical exclusion.""

""This is a singular case. In circumstances like these where NRC's decision has the almost guaranteed practical effect of extending the operating timeframe of a license beyond its original expiration date, such a decision is directly reviewable in our court under our broad and liberal reading of the Hobbs Act. Additionally, we hold that at least two of the Petitioners have standing.""

""[The] NRC was not required to provide a hearing or meet other procedural requirements before issuing the Exemption Decision because the Exemption was not a licensing proceeding. NRC adequately explained why California's changing energy needs constitute a special circumstance, and why the record supported its findings of no undue risk to the public health and safety.""

""NRC was not required to provide a hearing or meet other procedural requirements before issuing the Exemption Decision because the Exemption was not a licensing proceeding. NRC adequately explained why California's changing energy needs constitute a special circumstance, and why the record supported its findings of no undue risk to the public health and safety.""

Three green groups - Mothers for Peace, Environmental Working Group, and Friends of the Earth - filed a motion asking for the immediate closure of Diablo Canyon based on it posing an ""unacceptable safety risk.""

It remains a mind boggling mystery why so-called ""green groups"" continue efforts to stop the use nuclear energy to provide carbon emission free power in place of fossil fuel plants.

Diablo Canyon owner and operator Pacific Gas and Electric is planning to keep Unit 1 operational until October 2029 and Unit 2 until October 2030. It may keep it open longer depending on the outcome of a separate NRC licensing process.

California governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed legislation in 2022 that reversed a 2016 agreement between the state, PG&E and environmental groups to retire the facility. Newsom, once a leading voice to close the facility, said Diablo Canyon's power is needed beyond 2025 to ward off possible blackouts as California moves to solar and other renewable energy sources.

Newsom's administration has cited ""unprecedented stress"" on the state's energy system as a reason for keeping open Diablo Canyon, which alone accounts for 9% of the state's generation and 17% of its electricity from carbon-free sources.

Translation - It is a fact that voter will take their ire over blackouts on current elected officials.

The Bloomberg Wire Service reports that a month after the US offered $1.5 billion to restart Holtec's Palisades nuclear power plant, there's a growing sense among officials in the industry and government that it may not be the last.

""There are a couple of nuclear power plants that we probably should, and can, turn back on,"" said Jigar Shah, director of the US Energy Department's Loan Programs Office.

""A lot of the other players that have a nuclear power plant that has recently shut down and could be turned back on are gaining that confidence to try,"" said Shah in an interview with Bloomberg. He declined to name specific plants.

Shah's exuberance has support from DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. According to the Bloomberg report, while the federal government has not made a wholesale effort to revive shuttered plants, it sees reactors and their carbon-free power as ""extremely valuable assets,"" said Michael Goff, principal deputy assistant secretary for the Energy Department's Office of Nuclear Energy. Some closed plants clearly have the potential to be reopened, he said.

""Unless you do something irrevocable, they can be turned around,"" Goff said.

The US nuclear energy industry's trade group in Washington, DC, also weighed in.

""The environment has shifted significantly in a really short period of time,"" said Doug True, chief nuclear officer for the Nuclear Energy Institute trade group. ""I think there are companies that are looking at whether a restart makes sense.""

True estimates there may be only five reactors suitable for resurrection. He declined to name them.

(NucNet) Thai power company Global Power Synergy Public Company Limited (GPSC) has signed a memorandum of understanding with Denmark's Seaborg Technologies to explore the potential deployment of Seaborg's compact molten salt reactor (CMSR) floating ""power barge"" in Thailand. Under the MOU, GPSC and Seaborg will assess how the CMSR power barge could be used in Thailand to support the Southeast Asian country's transition to net-zero.

On April 24, 2024 Mr. Worawat Pitayasiri, President and Chief Executive Officer of Global Power Synergy Public Company Limited signed the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Mr. Klaus Nyengaard, Chief Executive Officer of Seaborg Technologies ApS, the developer of SMR technology in Denmark. The signing ceremony, presided by H.E. Mr. Jon Thorgaard, Ambassador of Denmark to Thailand and Cambodia, was organized at the Royal Danish Embassy, Sathorn, Bangkok, Thailand.

The study - expected to take about four years to complete - is intended to explore the use of electricity generated from Seaborg´s Power Barge to feed directly into the grid and to explore the potential use of the steam generated during operations. Thailand has no commercial nuclear plants,

The US said in 2022 it was planning to help the government build capacity for the deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. US Vice President President Kamala Harris visited Thailand in November 2022.

At the time she said US assistance was part of its Net Zero World Initiative, a project launched at last year's Glasgow climate summit in which the US partners with the private sector and philanthropists to promote clean energy. She did not name any potential US partners for a Thai nuclear power project. Thailand does not have a 123 Agreement with the US. The two countries will need to work together to sign off on one.

Seaborg's design is for modular CMSR power barges equipped with between two and eight 100 MW CMSRs, with an operational life of 24 years. In a CMSR reactor, the fuel is mixed with molten fluoride salt, which also acts as a coolant. The Power Barges are modular and can produce from 200 to 800 MW of electricity.

Last year Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and shipbuilder Samsung Heavy Industries of South Korea announced a consortium with Seaborg to develop floating nuclear plants using Seaborg's CMSR technology.

Floating nuclear plants are seen as a potential method of providing power to isolated regions and also for industry, mines, armed forces and disaster relief. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, they can be built in a factory, assembled in a shipyard and transported to a site, all of which may help to speed up construction and keep costs down.

According to wire service reports, Rolls-Royce has scaled back plans to build two new factories for its small modular reactor (SMR) program in the UK. It cited delays to a government design competition. This is the second time the UK government has frustrated private sector efforts to build SMRs in a fleet program.

Rolls-Royce has proposed building 16 470 MW PWRs at multiple locations around the UK for a total of 7.5 GW of carbon emission free electrical generation capacity. If built, the fleet would exceed the potential power once represented by the now cancelled four 1,350 MW BWRs slated for Wylfa and Oldbury under a previous ambitious UK government plan for 19 GW of nuclear power. It sank without a trace when the government failed to address a mechanism for covering anticipated cost increases and schedule delays in the first of a kind the massive project.

The company said it has been waiting for the outcome of an ongoing SMR design competition in the UK - first announced by the Government in 2015 - before it makes a decision on the pressure vessel plant.

The competition has been repeatedly delayed, with the UK government's Great British Nuclear ministry only formally created last summer. The ministry has a provisional award date of summer 2024. Six firms, including Rolls-Royce, are competitors for government funds.

Rolls-Royce had originally proposed one factory to make reactor pressure vessels for its SMRs and another to make the building other components for nuclear reactors. It reportedly had drawn up a final shortlist of multiple locations for the pressure vessels factory.

Rolls told wire services that it no longer intends to proceed with that plan because there is no longer time to build the factory and make the first pressure vessels for the early 2030s, when it hopes to complete its first SMRs. It will now buy its heavy pressure vessels from a third party supplier.

That supplier is most likely Sheffield Forgemasters which was nationalized by the Ministry of Defense in 2021. The firm has earned NQA-1 ASME certification to manufacture nuclear reactor components. The key question is whether Sheffield can scale up to meet demand and whether the government will fund the now nationalized plant to do so.",energycentral.com,news,Energy Central,,0.5137254901960784,452650085,11,,eng-9545936

Or follow us on Google News!

The carbon neutral goal is an elusive one, but progress has been reported in some unexpected spots. One of those is the European nation of Cyprus, which was hovering around rock bottom for renewable energy just a few years ago. Now the country has been picking up steam. In the latest development, Cyprus is trialing a new large scale, long duration compressed air energy storage system that leverages the water pressure of the ocean for maximum effectiveness.

Among European nations, Iceland hit the 100% renewable energy target all the way back in 2015. However, since Iceland is not a member of the European Union, the race to be the first EU nation to ditch fossil fuels from the power generation landscape is still wide open.

For a while there it looked like Cyprus was almost ready to give up the ghost. Nevertheless, on February 24 the Guardian took note of renewable energy progress in the EU, listing Cyprus among the nations reporting big gains.

There is still a long way to go, as the Guardian puts it. A rundown of the data from 2022 shows EU electricity consumption averaging about 41% from renewable resources, with Sweden and Denmark leading the pack at 83.3% and 77.2% respectively. Down at the bottom were Malta (10.1%), Hungary (15.3%), the Czech Republic (15.5%), and Luxembourg (15.9%), with Cyprus easing ahead of the bottom-dwellers at 18%.

A healthy dose of long duration energy storage would help nations like Cyprus climb the renewable energy ladder more quickly. Unlike lithium-ion battery systems that typically last about 4-6 hours, a long duration energy storage system can produce clean kilowatts for longer periods, lasting up to full days, weeks, or even seasons. At that level, intermittent sources -- namely, wind and solar energy -- could provide for nuclear-style stability, continuity, and reliability at a fraction of the cost of a new nuclear power plant.

The long duration energy storage field has been attracting furious activity on the part of investors and innovators, with some of the latest activity focusing on new long duration technologies that deploy the physics of heat transfer.

The natural systems of the Earth are also rich territory for long duration innovators. Pumped hydropower, for example, has been getting a second look in recent years. This decades-old, mature technology is a perfect fit for wind and solar power. It relies on the force of gravity to shunt water from an upper reservoir to a lower generating station. Ideally, the upper reservoir is refilled only when excess renewable energy is available to run the pumps (see our long duration archive here).

Compressed air is another long duration technology that has been getting a workout in the 2000s. Some of the earlier compressed air attempts have fallen by the wayside, but new iterations keep popping up.

Compressed air systems can leverage underground rock formations or human-made structures as storage platforms, though each has drawbacks. In underground storage the containerization is durable and readymade, and there is less potential conflict with land use on the surface. However, rock formations are geo-specific. Human-made platforms can potentially cover a much wider range of site options, but they are expensive and can run into roadblocks from competing land uses.

One solution that has crossed the CleanTechnica radar is underwater storage. Back in 2022 we took note of a bladder-based energy storage system that is sort of an underwater version of pumped hydro, leveraging water pressure instead of gravity.

Another take on deploying water pressure for energy storage comes from the Israeli startup BaroMar, which has come up with a simple sounding tank-based compressed air system. The system is designed for use at coastal areas and islands adjacent to deep water. The plan is to locate the tanks in depths of around 500 feet, where the water pressure is sufficient and conflicts with marine life are less in evidence.

""The hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding water enables construction of long-lasting large tanks at very low cost,"" BaroMar explains. Also assisting on the cost-cutting end of things is a design strategy focusing on eliminating underwater moving parts and subsystems. The tanks are constructed on shore, using marine-proven concrete and steel, then towed into place.

That sounds simple enough, though the devil is in the details. Earlier this week, the engineering firm Jacobs let word slip that it BaroMar selected it to produce the preliminary design for the Cyprus project, billed as a ""first-of-its-kind underwater large-scale, long-duration energy storage pilot project.""

Jacobs observes that BaroMar's energy storage solution deploys mature technologies in the fields of power, energy, and marine engineering. However, combining them with the hydrostatic pressure of seawater is a delicate act.

""This project requires extensive geophysical, geotechnical and bathymetric surveying, investigation, feasibility studying and permitting for tank installation at deep depths for onshore mechanical and electrical equipment needs,"" explained Jacobs Vice President Fiachra Ó Cléirigh.

As described by Jacobs, the Cyprus project will consist of large, rigid tanks ballasted on the seabed with a combined capacity of 4 megawatt-hours.

""The tanks are designed to resist loads imposed by the marine environment as well as the compressed air and hydrostatic water pressure, during both installation and operational conditions,"" Jacobs adds.

Excess electricity from wind and solar resources will be shunted by subsea cable to the tanks, where it feeds compressors. When more electricity is needed, the compressed air is fed back to land where it is expanded and fed into a generator.

Last September the nonprofit organization ISRAEL21c interviewed BaroMar founder Yonadav Buber, who explained that undersea tanks are less expensive to construct because the pressure of seawater acts as a stabilizer. Though site selection is limited to coasts and islands, these same locations are notoriously crowded. Opportunities for large scale, land-based energy storage are difficult to find.

""This is a really genius solution, because it circumvents the problem in a very elegant way. It also creates the possibility of more or less endless energy storage, because we're talking about the seabed, which is not exactly hot real estate,"" Buber told ISRAEL21c writer Naama Barak.

Buber emphasized that the technology components are mature and are not in need of extensive development, unlike some of the other new long duration energy storage technologies emerging today. He noted that marine-related regulatory and engineering requirements are the main challenges that lie between the pilot project and commercial deployment.

When Buber spoke to ISRAEL21c last fall, he indicated that Cyprus meets the three main client categories targeted by BaroMar. One consists of renewable energy producers with surpluses on hand, and the second consists of large scale energy consumers including port facilities and other large industrial complexes.

""And our third type of customer is governments,"" Buber added. ""We're in discussions, for example, with the government of Cyprus, to make them the first member state of the European Union to run on 100 percent renewable energy by 2030.""

Whether or not that ambitious goal is possible remains to be seen. However, in February our friends over at PV Magazine reported that Cyprus already expects to curtail a good 28% of its renewable energy production in 2024, so it clearly has a hefty surplus on hand.

PV Magazine cited a lack of energy storage facilities and the absence of sufficient interconnections with other countries as the main drivers of renewable energy overproduction in Cyprus.

If you're thinking green hydrogen could help soak up some of those excess clean kilowatts, Cyprus is one step ahead of you. In 2022 Cyprus earned the title of ""laggard"" in a rundown of EU national hydrogen strategies, but the very next year a consortium of 27 nations organized to tap Cyprus to host the EU's first ""Hydrogen Valley"" in Cyprus. We'll be keeping an eye out for next steps but so far the focus is on green hydrogen sourced from water, leveraging power from renewable resources.
