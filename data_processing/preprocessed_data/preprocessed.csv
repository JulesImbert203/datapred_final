2024-05-20 16:08:07,"ENERTIME (FR0011915339 - ALENE), a French company specializing in ""CleanTech"" technology for industrial energy efficiency and geothermal or biomass energy production, is proud to be featured in the prestigious ""The Innovation Leaders"" ranking, placing 5th out of 200 companies overall and 1st in the energy sector.

This ranking, launched by ""Les Echos"" in partnership with Statista, aims to highlight French companies that excel in innovation and best practices.

Gilles David, CEO of ENERTIME, affirms: ""Being in the TOP 5 of Innovation Leaders in France is a great source of pride for all ENERTIME employees, past and present, who have developed over the past fifteen years, a unique proprietary technology in high-power turbomachinery and thermodynamic machines essential for the energy transition. This success is due not only to our teams but also to our shareholders who have supported us and to our clients who took the risk of trusting a young independent SME.""

Innovation Rooted in French Scientific Excellence

ENERTIME's technologies, based on thermodynamics combined with rotating machinery design, exploit a science born in France 200 years ago that is essential to the energy transition. They offer decarbonized and decentralized solutions as an alternative to centralized production solutions.

Tailored Solutions for Industrial Needs

ENERTIME provides customized systems for industrial clients, developing a unique ability to understand and address their issues, which fosters continuous and sustainable innovation.

Strategic Vision Coupled with Innovation

With full ownership of its intellectual property and patents, ENERTIME can deploy its technologies, developed on Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines, in other fields. These capabilities are a significant asset for developing high-temperature, high-power heat pumps (HTHP). The natural gas expansion turbine installed for GRTgaz in Villiers-le-Bel and the partnership with STOLECT illustrate other successful applications of these technologies.

Inherently Competitive Technologies

A high-power ORC (typically 2 to 3 MW) for waste heat recovery is a very competitive solution with a typical LCOE[1] of €62/MWhe. A high temperature heat pump producing steam, reduces the CO2 emissions of steam production by a factor of ten in France and is 2 to 3 times more efficient than an electric boiler. It also avoids pollutant emissions associated with biomass or RDF[2] combustion. ENERTIME has developed these complex technologies without decarbonization subsidies, which were nonexistent before 2021, and plans to build 10 new machines in two years, in addition to the 12 commissioned between 2012 and 2023.

Strong International Ambition

To become competitive, decarbonization technologies must target a global market. ENERTIME has always aimed to develop relevant international solutions to compensate for a domestic market that take time to open. This strategy has led to successes on three continents and exports to eleven countries. ENERTIME expects most of its revenue to come from exports by 2030. In May 2024, ENERTIME was labeled an Efficient Solution for its ORC modules by the Solar Impulse Foundation and joined this global alliance.

ABOUT ENERTIME

Created in 2008, ENERTIME designs, develops, and implements Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines, gaz expansion turbines and high temperature heat pumps for industrial energy efficiency and decentralized production of renewable energy. ORC machines convert heat into electricity. Heat pumps use low-temperature heat to produce high-temperature heat.

ENERTIME is the only player offering ORC machines and a portfolio of technology in the field of thermodynamics for the energy transition.

2024-05-22 17:13:59,"... All right here. Subscribe now atCRAVE.CA. >> This is certainly a surprise to us, but just at depths of need right across the country that unfortunately is not being met with a sense of urgency. Canada has reached a critical turning point as more people are struggling with poverty and food insecurity. >> That was on for too many events. That was not too many things and the person were there. >> 3 young males, including a 15 year-old boy are dead after being stabbed in a fight in montreal. He says at the start and important state. I'm from dallas tonight. Ireland, norway and spain plan to formally recognize a palestinian state move, angering israel. But a welcome by hamas. You're watching ctv news channel. I'm roger petersen. Thank you very much for joining us. >> Well, some sobering numbers when it comes to food insecurity in canada, in its annual poverty report. Cards. Food banks. Canada warns that we have reached a critical point as poverty and food insecurity worsened in every corner of the country. Canada received an overall grade of d minus. That's a drop from the d last year, only to provinces nova scotia and prince edward island managed to improve the rest of the country remain stagnant or worsened. >> Putting together housing plan, looking at yours, social assistance or benefits rates, making sure their indexed to inflation so that people are falling further and further behind into poverty. And then what we're suggesting for provinces that don't and put together a coordinated poverty reduction plan with with target so that you can hold your government to account and citizens can see that your government is taking action. Digging deeper into the numbers. The report found that more than 44% of people are feeling worse off when compared to last year. >> The percentage of people paying more than 30% of their income on housing hit 43.6% in 2024. Joining us now to discuss this further is neil hetherington, the ceo of the daily bread food bank. Neil, thank you for joining us. Unfortunately, you have to join us. >> Unfortunately, this is yet another it's an academic report that showing very clearly what we're feeling on the ground every single day here at the daily bread food bank here in toronto. >> How do we bring about change? I mean, we hear these reports after report after report. What do we do? >> Well, I think that's the frustrating part to us here at the food bank is we know the policy we know what is going on in the city and in the country. A it is a failing mark canadians overall are feeling financially worse off about 50% are financially worse off the year prior than they are this year. And we we know the policy alternatives, we know that it's, there is a lack of affordable housing income supports are not keeping pace and precarious employment is on the rise. >> Now we were seeing from 2021. The usage is up 50% of food banks. Where's that coming from? Is it to people, some people who are already destitute, are they just getting used to be using the food bank's accepted as part of their life or is it are more and more people being driven into situations where they have to turn to you. >> You know, it's, it's new people every single unfortunately are welcoming about 12 to 13,000 torontonians who have never used a food bank before are coming to the food bank for the very first time on a monthly basis. We're growing at 3 to 5% here in city of toronto, each every single month. This past april, there were 311,000 client visits up from about 60,000 and pre-pandemic. So the numbers continue to escalate. And you asked, you know, importantly, who's coming to the food bank individuals more than 50% to have a employment. And yet they can't make ends meet largely because of inflation that has started to, to taper moose. I'm very, very pleased to see the numbers that came out last week or so showing that inflation is under 3%. On the right trajectory >> How are you keeping up in toronto with this, with this growing demand? Well, it's not we're keeping up because there's incredible volunteers. There's a wonderful network of

agencies were responding to the call. But I got to tell you, rodger, the there is a growing sense of concern and a growing sense of frustration we have for year after year said there are clear policy alternatives that need to be implemented. Policies like the canada disability where if we, you know, just invested in that type of a program. We have the possibility of lifting up about a million and half canadians out of into a situation where they might thriving community. We know the policy solutions, we just need to have the governments at all levels have the fortitude and courage be able to implement them. And how would that work? That policy changes like to see. >> Well, yeah, I mean, when it comes to the canada disability benefit, we were very hopeful that it would be fully funded, meaning that somebody who currently is on disability in ontario, they receive about $1300 federally. There is to be a better $1000 top up to that. So they could at least be at the poverty the I was pleased to see in the federal budget, the re emphasis on affordable housing. So making sure that we are back building affordable housing and making sure that their rent supplements in place. And then I think provincially there are a whole host of measures to to start to decrease precarious employment to many people come to the food bank have full-time working, but are unable to have that allow them to be able to thriving community. We talk about the government helping out what the private sector do. >> Well, I think the private sector in a more often than not looking to to making sure that they are paying living wages. So not just minimum wage, but living wages so that their employees can have a decent place to live in the community that they're, they're working. You're right, it's not just a full exercise, but they ultimately have a duty of care to make sure that everybody's right to housing and everybody's right to food is realized so that food banks like the daily bread, food bank and food banks, canada all across the country can start to see the lineups decrease rather than the trajectory that they're currently on. >> And I mean, I know you do what you focus on and which is one of the most expensive cities in the world. But this is also an issue in smaller towns and and smaller municipalities. >> Abs, absolutely. And they don't have the same supports that we might have in a in larger urban areas. I mean, you just have to look at what's on the screen right now, right across the country. We're seeing, you know, a lot of red, we're seeing, you know, seasoned ease across the country when it comes to investments in affordable housing, when it comes to making sure that people have that a decent incomes, making sure that we've got an economy that allows businesses to thrive so that they can pay those living wages. >> Ok neal, thank you very much for joining us today. Always appreciate it. Neil hetherington is the ceo of the daily bread food bank. We're also getting a better sense of how canadians feel about the state of grocery prices in canada. The majority believe costs at stores are still climbing. A new leger poll found 29% blame the ryman rising costs on grocery chains who they believe are attempting to increase their profit margins. Senior director of the agri-food analytics lab at dalhousie university. Sylvain charlebois says he's not surprised. >> People have less money to spend on too. And they feel they feel desperate. And so they're looking to blame something, someone and he's is seeing ad to the one component, the supply chain that most people understand is the grocery store. But food inflation is much more complicated than that. But I'm not surprised to see the anger. The collective anger from some people out there. >> The federal government has introduced a voluntary code of conduct for major grocers to trying to promote fairness and transparency in the industry. Canada's biggest grocer loblaw has signed on industry minister francois-philippe champagne says he is hopeful others will follow suit. >> Seeing that inflation is going down. Why we have in recent years with respect to loblaw signing on it's a step in the right we have been in touch with walmart and costco and I'm hopeful that he will sign and that's, you know, if you talk grocers of kind of one of the key step to stabilize prices in canada. So we're going to keep about what we're going to keep on working with that. But I'm hopeful that everyone in the >> And frustration over high grocery prices pumped prompted a boycott of loblaw own stores this month. Now organizers say the protest we'll go beyond may 1st. According to the organizers, people supporting the boycott want to keep the movement going a release as the boycotters find a focus on advocacy efforts in the months ahead. Emily johnson is one of the key organizers and says the boycott has been a uniting moment for community members.

>> Ideally, what we wanted to do was just raise awareness of the drastically increasing cost of groceries means, you know, the fact that we do have control and power as consumers we never imagined in a million years that we had today. You know, 80,000 members on our subreddit own and and that there are 20,000 members between should kochan are instagram, it's its and we're just incredibly surprised by the viral atf. It. >> Well, a lot has pushed back against criticism of the company, saying it's not responsible for higher food prices. The canadian grocery chain has been expanding its discount stores to accommodate for the higher prices. And a live look in london, 10 downing street where we're waiting to hear from british prime minister rishi sunak's. He will be delivering a statement outside that famous store there likely announcing a summer general election. We'll take you there live when the prime minister speaks. Norway, spain and ireland have announced their intention to formally recognize a palestinian state, a declaration that would take effect on tuesday spoken with a number of of the heaters and counterparts. >> I'm confident that for other countries will join us and taking this important step in the coming weeks. >> Leaders from the 3 countries say they hope the move brings new momentum toward a 2 state solution, adding it's not a decision against israel or in favour of hamas, but instead one in support of peace. Israel reacted angrily to the move, calling the decision distorted. >> Israel claims that this is a reward to hamas. And I suggested it is not a reward ice who has no interest in 2 states, has no interest in the continuation of israel's existence. It's, it's a reward to moderates in the palestinian authority who already cooperate with israel. >> Israel has now recalled its ambassadors to ireland, norway and spain and some of their envoys. Hamas, meantime, welcomed the news news and is calling on other nations to follow suit. Meanwhile, in rafah, food distribution has been suspended due to a lack of supplies and insecurity. That according to the united nations. Well, prime minister trudeau says he is sticking by house speaker greg fergus, despite another controversy. We have full confidence in rexburg fergus as a. >> As a speaker, that is a common says a, a independent minded leader. The was dealt with was addressed by the party and by the house leader. It was unfortunate mistake. >> The issue is an invitation to a quote, summer evening with greg fergus and also referenced reckless policies of the conservatives, both conservative and bloc mp's are calling on fergus to step down. Ctv news political commentator scott reid says he doesn't see the attacks on fergus stopping anytime soon. Greg fergus is never going to moment's peace as speaker, he will be under constant fire. The conservatives opposed him when he was a candidate for speaker. >> They have pounced on the stakes city is made and they've made it clear that even in instances like this, where the mistake wasn't really his, they're going to hold him to account. So I think you're going to see great for guests on the grill over and over and over again. >> Let's go back to london now, where british prime minister rishi sunak is making a statement. >> I stood behind one of the podiums upstairs in the building behind me. I told you that we faced a generation defining moment and that we as a society would not be judged by some government action. >> But by the small acts of kindness that we showed, one of us. You met that challenge. And then some and I have never been proud to be british. When I introduce the follows skate. I did so not because I saw rick country simply in need of desperate help, little bit. We want. But because ice or a country, his future hung in the balance. I could be bold interest in the 10's of millions of you at home, that you would rise to the moment or I could accept the inevitable millions of job losses and pick up the pieces. In truth, it was no choice at all. I have never and will never leave the people of this country to face the darkest of days. Ally and you do that because you've seen it. I was like did that. I will forever do everything in my power to provide you with the strongest possible protection I can. That is my promise to you. Because for so many of us, it's easy to forget the scale of what we've been through. We were hit by pandemic upended

normal life. Who would have thought that the government would have to tell us how many times a day we could leave odds. Then just as we were recovering from covid full return to europe. With putin's invasion of ukraine energy bill spiring. I came to office the bubble to restore economic stability economic stability is the bedrock of any future success. Whether that is rising wages and good jobs investment in our public services. All the defensive, the country. And because of all collective sacrifice and your homework. We have reached 2 major milestones in delivering that stability. Showing that when we work together, anything as possible. Our economy is now growing faster than anyone predicted. Outpacing germany, france and the united states. >> And this morning, it was confirmed that inflation is back to normal. This means that the pressure on price israelis and mortgage rates will come down. This is proof that the plan and parties I set out on work. I recognize that it is not always been easy. Some of you with any just be starting to feel the benefit. And for some, it might still be hard. When you look at your bank balance. But this hold and economic stability was only ever meant to be the beginning. The question now is how and who do you trust to time that foundation into a secure future for you, your family and our country. Is the moment for britain to choose its future. To decide whether we want to build on the progress we have made risk going back to square one with no plan and no certainty. And today I spoke with his majesty, the king to request the dissolution of parliament. The king has grown to this request. We will have a general election on the 4th of july. This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the cold. Putin's russia is waging a brutal war in ukraine and will not stop there. If he succeeds. That war is also made it all too clear the risk to our energy security. In the middle east. The forces of business to extremism threaten regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are exploited by extremists who seek to undermine our values and a volatile society here at heart. China, it's looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a leading technology. And migration is being weaponized by a stall states threatened the integrity of our. These uncertain times cool for a clip. Lot bold action to chart a course to a secure future. You must choose in this election who has stopped. Who is prepared to take the bold action necessary to secure a better future for our country and our children. I cannot and will not play. We have got everything right. No government. I'm proud of what we have achieved together. The bold actions we have taken. I'm confident about what we can do in the future. We've tackled inflation controlled at caldwell cuts taxes and increase the state pension by 900 pounds. We've reduced taxes on investment, can seize the opportunities of brexit to make this the best country in the world to grow the business. That record amounts of funding into our nhs and ensure it is now trading. The doctors in the U.S. says it needs in the decades to come. We've reformed education and our children. Now the best returns in the west. We parts always energy security and your family finances over environmental do in our approach. And that's their right. We fully funded an increase in defence spending to 2 and a half percent of gdp. We made a decision to invest more in local transport you actually use rather than endlessly plow more money into hs 2. We set out a comprehensive plan to reform our welfare system to make it fast for those who pay for it as well as those who need it. Immigration is finally coming down and we all stopping the boats with our one departments. We will ensure that the next generation gross out smoke-free. I hope that my work since I became prime minister. Shows that we have apply and all for pat to take bold action necessary for all countries to flourish. I stuck with that plan and always been honest with you about what is needed, even when that's been difficult. Because I'm guided by doing what is right for our country. Not what is easy. I can say the same thing for the labour party. Because I don't know what. And in truth. I don't think, you know, ina. And that's because they have to plan. There is no action. And as a result, the future can only be on site. And with that. On the 5th of july and the

customer on will be prime minister. He has shown time and time again that he will take the easy way out and do anything to get power. If he was happy to abandon all the promises he made to become lately that once he got the job. How can you know that he would do exactly the same thing if he were to become prime minister. If you don't have the conviction to stick to anything you say. If you don't have the courage to tell people what you want to do. And if you don't have a plan. How can you possibly be trusted to lead our country, especially at this most uncertain of times. Over the next few weeks. I will fight for every vote I will on your trust. I will prove to you.

In response, the crown attorney's office says >> This decision should not be seen as a criticism of the police determination that there were reasonable grounds for the arrests of these 4 individuals. However, the standard for proceeding with a prosecution is properly higher and more rigorous. The indigo bookstore has been the subject of boycott campaigns for years over its founders has stick foundation for loans. Soldiers advocates say calling out the company is a form of activism against a foundation which offers scholarships to people without family in israel, who nevertheless served in the israeli military as jews, we say calling out companies that support israeli war crimes is a legitimate form of protest targeting indigo is not antisemitic. >> Lawyers for the 7 people who are still being prosecuted are calling for all charges to be dropped.

Yes, even heroes... ...should think protection. Ask about Prevnar 20 today. [surfer rock plays] [giggling] Ahh! Announcer: Son of a Critch. Watch free onCBC Gem. e]This is yourMarketplace. Have you been sold on the cold? [indistinct] [Charlsie]Plenty of peopleare boasting about the benefitsof cold plunging. But curing anxiety, losing weight, really? It's time to kill... or, should we say chill the buzz? In recent years, cold plunging has been heavily promoted. [lighthearted music playing] From dedicated practitioners with faithful followers... We are ableto defy inflammation. [Charlsie]...to the latestdirect to consumer offerings. [woman shrieking] Cold plunges aren't for everyone. [Charlsie]Denis Blondin has studied the effects of cold water as an associate professorof health science. [Denis] We've heard a lot of influencers getting really, really interested in cold plunges. We hear them repeat a lot of the same talking points, often based on really bad data. [Charlsie]So, let's thaw out some of those claims we're seeing on our feeds. [upbeat music playing] Can cold plunging help inflammation after a workout? It might be a benefit in some cases, or might be a hindrance in other cases. [Charlsie]Cold plunging after lifting weights can slow muscle recovery, reducing gains. But it might help you recover from endurance training faster. Can cold plunging help you lose weight? There's no evidence that cold will help you lose weight. [Charlsie] Can cold plunging help with depression or anxiety? There are some indications, yes, that it can. But I think there's more work that needs to be done. Thing is, being cold actually gives your body a similar physical response to a bit of exercise. Running up a flight of stairs can be a lot more comfortable and produce similar results. And that deep breathingtechnique taught by manyavid cold plungers... [breathing deeply] ...it's a form of meditation, and experts say that's wherea lot of the benefits people claim to experiencecan come from. [synthetic voice] Ice plunge with me. [Charlsie]Blondin also says ""Cold plunging can be unsafe."" This is so much [bleep] harder than it looks. We've heard of instances where people are doing cold water swimming and have drowned. It's not-- They haven't drowned because they can't swim. They drown from this strong cold shock response of this big gasp and this hyperventilation. [Charlsie]Cold plunges can put you into fight... or flight mode. It's why so many feel energized after a dip. But the cold water can also slow your heart rate and your body down. If you have any known or unknown heart issues, experts say you should not do it. If you cold plunge for longer, there's a risk you might become hypothermic, which you might not even realize. Blondin says ""One thing is clear, cold plunging is not a slam dunk, and more science is needed."" It really depends on the type of cold you're doing, how frequently you're doing it, how long you're doing it, so you can't kind of lump them all together. So, if you still want to give cold plunging a go, you're going to want to check with your doctor first. Ask if there's a family history of any cardiovascular issues. If the doctor gives you the all-clear, remember, don't go cold plunging alone. And keep it short. Asha:This season... What was the first indication that you'd been scammed? There was amarketplaceTV show. Woman:We've uncovered what you need to know. Woman 2: I don't think I'm ready. Wow. How bad could it be? Man:Revealing the truth about what we're buying.

I actually have an uncle who died in world war I and I'm buried in france. >> Deana: and in the war in ukraine, ukrainians are dealing with a russian guided missile strike in a crowded hardware store. Ukrainian officials say two russian guided bombs hit the store, killing two people and injuring dozens more. Several more people were injured in a missile strike in a residential area. Ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky called it another demonstration of russian madness. Zelensky offered his sympathies to the victims' families and says ukraine needs help from western leaders to beef up air defence systems which has been the target of russian attacks for weeks. Russian officials say there was also an attack by ukraine inside their borders. >> There's a lot of attacks that are going to take place physically and diplomatecally. >> Reporter: there's a summit next month in switzerland that russia will not be present. >> Both sides are positioning themselves into a better negotiating position, if you will. >> Reporter: the international conference in june is set to be in sweden, but russia's --

russia says any talks without ukraine present is a waste of time. >> Deana: word of a new diplomatic push in the israel war with hamas began to leak out when prime minister benjamin netanyahu said his government would defy a court order and press on with the war in gaza. Now with fighting in its 34 week, pressure is growing on the netanyahu government domestically. This was the scene in tel aviv as many people, including family members of those in captivity, say new negotiations need to take place. >> Reporter: what we've seen the last few hours is there were these meetings in paris between the C.I.A. chief, the israeli mossad chief, and the qatari prime minister. Next week, there's going to be talks between the same parties and egypt, and then hamas will be brought in. It's significant also because of the i.c.j., the international court of justice of israel to stop fighting and particularly -- particularly in gaza.

Remarks by a university of manitoba med school graduate are at the heart of this story. Dr. Gem newman urged graduates to speak out on the israel-hamas war as well as the actions of israel in gaza. Those condemning the remarks were earnest rady, the donor of the largest donation in the university's history. He called the speech ""hate and lies."" . Newman responded by saying it's ironic that demanding a ceasefire and calling for the rights of humans is considered hateful. >> Universities have faced major cutbacks from the public sector over the last couple of decades and are increasingly reliant on these things, and that's why they're taking this position. I think it's not particularly controversial to call for a ceasefire, and the donor has the right to withdraw that contribution. The problem is there's a power imbalance here and that the university really requires the funding, and so the honour gets more priority in this conversation. >> Deana: toronto police are looking for two suspects after finding evidence of gunfire at a jewish elementary school. The investigation began after a report of a bullet in the window for the jewish school for girls. Just after 5:00 a.m., two occupants in a vehicle pulled up and fired a gun towards it. >> The integrated task force is

the lead investigator on this, however, we have the support of the hate crimes unit, as well. One of the questions that people are asking is, is this a hate crime or is this a terrorist act? What I'm going to say is it's too early to saw that. We're not going to ignore this and what the target of the shooting was, but at the same time, it would be premature to react to that at this point. >> Deana: the prime minister has put out a statement, calling this a despicable act of cowardice. >>> Microgroups and their supporters protested saturday in montreal.

This as a deadline approaches for them to remove their camp.

For instance, israeli institutions and those that they say would be a b tied to the war in gaza or looking at any divestments from universal for many israeli companies, that potentially could be part of the war or sanctions. They're

out. So that is essential changes that they've offered in their counterproposal. They'll be presenting that to the university administration later on today. As you mentioned, feel at 5:00pm.

2024-05-26 19:16:23,"when you get through, you can turn the sign off. You don't know when to turn the seat belt sign on. If you leave it on all the time, people are going to ignore it. They'll get up and walk anyway to use the restroom. You can expect the seat belt sign won't be on more than likely when you encounter this unexpected turbulence. >> Linda: if you can't see it coming, clear turbulence as a pilot, what can you do beyond quickly turning that seat belt light on? >> Well, by then it's too late. We have speeds called turbulence penetration speeds. If we had anticipated the turbulence, we could have slowed the airplane to that particular speed. Because there's no warning, we can't do anything. Once the turbulence occurs, turn on the seat belt sign on it's really too late. Folks don't have time to fasten their belts to get to their seats. >> Linda: we had a pretty similar incident even more severe earlier this week. A man dying of suspected heart attack, dozens injured in a flight to singapore. Given that these incidents happened just days apart and we heard of recent incidents that are similar as well. How do you think this is affecting the public's perception about flight safety? >> Well, you're going to incur a certain amount of turbulence as well as normal turbulence. If you fasten your seat belt, it's probably not going to bother you. It's the folks that didn't do that that got injured. It's easy to prevent injury. That's the main takeaway. Passengers have to be prepared at any time to anticipate some turbulence. >> Linda: that's aviation expert and former airline pilot keith mackey. For the first time in months, hamas has hit central israel with rocket attacks. Militant group says it launched a barrage of projectile from rafah in southern gaza. Journalist irris makler is in jerusalem and has the details. >> Reporter: what we know is that the barrage of something like eight rockets, crossed into israeli airspace. Most of them were intercepted. There was minor injuries, minor damage. Very few injuries to people. Nevertheless, most of that was injuries from shrapnel. Israelis in the centre of the country were running to the bomb shelters. Airport was closed. It did have an impact on israel. What hamas said it's interesting. It's been four months since the last barrage to central israel. Hamas claimed responsibility. Pretty smartly. They said they were doing it in retaliation to israel's massacre. What israel says is this. They are firing from rafah. That's also significant. They are firing from rafah as israeli troops advance. They know once those rockets and weapons are located, they will destroy them. They are using it before they can be destroyed. Nevertheless, they have given some ammunition to right wing politicians in israel who say how can you stop fighting in rafah when there's still sufficient weapons there to be fired into central israel? >> Linda: this latest escalation came after eight trucks came through israel to bypass the rafah crossing through egypt. What can you tell us about that? >> Reporter: hundreds of trucks were lined outside the rafah crossing since israel took that crossing on may 6th. It's not far, 5 kilometres down the road to an israeli border crossing. They are going in from there. Some 200 trucks ready to go in. Much of the food has already spoiled. We have heard from palestinian sources inside the gaza strip that eight trucks had gone in with fuel and cooking gas. That is significant. What's coming in from the other pier that the U.S. set up is a smaller amount of aid. It's more expensive to get in. It doesn't come in the same quantity. Everybody is advocating for aid to come in by land through the old system through these border crossings. However, the problem is distribution. What we're hearing from the owner of the U.N. refugee agency, once it gets in it's hard to get it out. Especially to the something like 900,000 palestinians estimated to be on the coast having fled rafah. How do you get them to the coastal area. There's nothing there but the

but the tents that they put up. There's no infrastructure. All of those issues, has to be said the fact that some aid is going in. >> Linda: that's irris makler in jerusalem. Representatives from dozens of countries are in brussels to talk about the future of the palestinian authority. The meeting comes just days before three european countries are set to recognise a palestinian state. >> The palestinian government calls on all states that have not yet recognised the state of palestine to take this principle decision as soon as possible. >> Linda: that was palestinian prime minster today thanking spain, norway and ireland for their decision to officially recognise the palestinian state later this week. He calls on the international community to pressure israel for a cease-fire. Today's meeting in brussels is a chance for countries to exchange views about the plans and priorities of the palestinian authority which currently controls the west bank. Several european countries say that the palestinian authority should take over the control of gaza from hamas. Meanwhile, at the university of toronto, organizers from a pro-palestinian encampment have released a counter proposal they plan to present to school officials later today. >> This process is slow. Bureaucratic and archaic. We reject playing a game that will go nowhere. Our counteroffer is built on the fact that the office of the president has the ability to create new processes and make decisions on divestments. >> Linda: they want the university of toronto to divest fully from israel and suspend any ties to the country. The counterproposal will be handed to school officials ought 5:00 P.M. eastern time. Protesters have been issued a trespass notice and told to leave by 8:00 tomorrow morning. U of t presented an a ever last week that the school says claims has investment in weapons manufacturing companies in israel has no bases in fact. Also in toronto, police are searching for multiple suspects who fired gunshots at a jewish girl elementary school. >> Suspects arrived at the school in a vehicle. Dark coloured vehicle. They exited the vehicle and opened fire at the school causing damage to the front of the school. The suspect then got back in the vehicle and left the area. There were no reported sound of gunshots at the time. There was no reported injuries. >> Linda: the force hate crime unit is helping with the investigation and police are increasing their presence in the local community. Prime minster justin trudeau and ontario premier doug ford have taken to social media to condemn the shooting and call it an act of anti-semitism. The prime minster will attend ceremonies marking the 80th verse of the d-day landing in france next month. It will be the first time justin trudeau has attended the event since the 75th anniversary in 2019. More than 14,000 canadian soldiers landed or parachuted into france on june 6, 1944. Suffering more than a thousand casualties that day including 359 killed. The battle of normandy saw 5000 canadian troops lose their lives. Thousands more wounded. We're back in just a moment.

The U.S. has responded to an appeal today by volodymyr zelensky. The ukrainian president called on U.S. joe biden and chinese leader xi jinping to take part in a peace summit in switzerland next month. The U.S. will take part but didn't say who or at what level. The summit is approaching as russian forces advance on the eastern front and continues to target the northeastern city of kharkiv. Bomb and missile strikes there saturday killed four people and wounded dozens of others. Ukraine is hoping the meeting in switzerland will help increase international pressure on russian president vladimir putin. U.S. presidential hopeful donald trump was heckled last night while campaigning at the the libertarian national convention. >> I think you should nominate me and vote for me. We should win together. >> Linda: trump's supporters and libertarians repeatedly clashed during the event. Resulting in several members of the audience being escorted out of the building. Trump is hoping to appeal libertarians ahead what is forecast to be a tight election this november. The campaign stop underscores the focus of trump's campaign on third party candidates. This week, british prime minster rishi sunak announced earlier an expected general alex. -- election. Scott lucasabilitys the election campaign will be all about the economy. >> The starting point is simply that britain is not in a better place under the tories who have led a coalition or been the sole party in power since 2010. The situation has gotten far worse through the combination of the covid pandemic and the u.k.'s self-inflicted wound of leaving the european union. G.D.P. is probably going to suffer in relative terms by 8% to 9% by 2030 because of that decision in the european union. Trade suffered. Investment has suffered. Inflation is down to 2.3% now. That fall is not as much as economist were expecting because of our year on year drop on energy prices. I think the prospect of U.K. economy is not good. Beyond that, the day-to-day public services that have been better off british society, a transport system that serves all people, housing, education. Those are at breaking point and because the government has a serious funding crisis in part, because of the damage trade, damage investment, damage to manufacturing with brexit. It doesn't have the money to repair those public services. >> Linda: scott lucas from the clinton institute at university college dublin. Stay with us. More news just ahead.

The fans that inspired that canadian classic is back. He was the co-writer on brian adams hit ""summer of 69"". It was inspired by his first band. Last night they reunited at their old stomping ground. The school in british columbia. It -- they played songs and relived some of the best kays kay -- days of their lives. We spoke to jim valance earlier and how they came up with ""summer of 69"" >> We kept in touch all these years. I met these guys when I was 13 in grade eight. My dad got moved every two years. We kept in touch after that. I see them once a decade may be, go back to school reunion or something. Last night was special. It was the first time we actually played together in more than 60 years. Brian and I started off, before I met him I was in a canadian band. Once I met brian in 1978, it was not overnight success.

It kind of becomes your normal. There's no pressure. It's hard work but really enjoyable. Sometimes I stop and think to myself, it's been a wonderful ride. I have to say. Brian and I sitting in the room and we started that song with a discussion about what do you want to write about today. We decided we would write about our first band or first guitars or first girlfriends. One line at a time the page starts to fill up with lyrics. We finished the song in a day or two. It was called ""best days of your life."" it stayed like that for a month.

we had a better title somewhere. Tucked away in the first verse was it was the summer of 69. We thought summer of 69. That's got a great ring to it. If you remember your english class, it's called alliteration, ""summer of 69"" we took that phrase and shoe horned it later in the song and changed the title of the song. >> Linda: jim valance speaking to us earlier from british columbia.

We begin another mid-air incident that left multiple people injured. It happened on a qatar airways plane flying from the middle east to dublin. Cbc's albert delitala is looking into what happened. >> Reporter: 12 people were injured when that qatar airways flight hit turbulence on its way to dublin. The airport does say that it landed safely and on time. But certainly, some scary moments.

let's show you on a map just where it happened. The airport confirms the qatar airways flight hit turbulence while flying over turkiye. The incident reportedly lasting less than 20 seconds according to passengers. It happened during the food and drink service on the plane. Six passengers and six crew reported injuries. You can see some of the scenes there after that plane safely landed meeting emergency crew when it did on the ground. Here's some passengers who spoke to irish public broadcaster R.T.E. after they got off the plane. >> We were all over the plane and everywhere. [ indiscernible ] >> Flight attendant went into the air. Food went everywhere. It was panic everywhere. >> Reporter: the airline calls the injuries minor and said that those who were injured are receiving medical attention. It didn't directly comment on the turbulence. It did say that an internal investigation is happening into that incident. >> Linda: sounds like a pretty harrowing incident according to the passengers on that flight. It also sounds like we're hearing about these things more frequently lately. This comes just days after a fatal incident on a singapore airlines flight. Tell us more about that. >> Reporter: that was on tuesday singapore airlines flight. That flight hit severe turbulence on its way to singapore from london. A 73-year-old british man died of suspected heart attack. You can see some of the scenes on that plane after all of that. 20 people sent to the I.C.U. the U.S. transportation safety board says turbulence is the most common kind of airplane incident. Most of those incidents result in one or more serious injuries. One airline say the analyst says turbulence is becoming more common with climate change. That airlines are adjusting their planes accordingly. >> Over the last 20 years, [ indiscernible ] multiscan, which is mentioned really good picture of what the weather is like ahead. They are making progress into turbulence detection as well. Also, airlines are now sharing data between aircraft encounters with turbulence everybody can be advised that's on that same flight track. >> Reporter: in terms of that singapore airline incident, the airlines says it is cooperating with investigators on the investigation there. That plane that returned to singapore today from bangkok where it made that emergency landing. Many of the passengers remain in bangkok where they are being treated. >> Linda: that was cbc's albert delitala. Keith mackey the former airline pilot and aviation expert. He spoke to us how to protect yourself. >> Reporter: apparently they were secking meals. Settlement of the injured were flight attendants. They were walking about the cabinets to get the meals out. Other six passengers injured, I would wager were not fastening their seat belts. If this occurs and it can happen very suddenly without any warning at all. If you're not strapped in there's a good chance you'll get brain and upper spinal injuries. While you're seated, keep that belt fastened. Not loosely fastened but keep it firmly fastened. If you're in a car wreck, you wouldn't want to have a loosely fastened seat belt. >> Linda: the turbulence that they hit, are there any clues that you can glean from what we're hearing about the flight about what this airplane encountered? >> Well, here's the situation. If you have no turbulence, if flying through area of thunderstorms. You know the storms are there. You warn the people what to expect. Usually if it's some turbulence associated with it. It's not for naught turning the seat belt sign on. When you get through, you can turn the sign off. You don't know when to turn the seat belt sign on. If you leave it on all the time,

Although where they are willing to travel might not be what you expect.

Deloitte canada summer outlook shows that this year canadians are willing to travel despite these economic challenges, more than three-quarters of canadians surveyed said they plan to spend the same or more on summer vacation this year, while only 18% won't be travelling at all. With the average canadian willing to pay roughly $2400 for their summer trip this year. But while travellers are planning to spend more this summer, they're also prioritizing keeping trips local three quarters of canadians plan to stay in the country.

And we had an earlier statement from the idf saying that these strikes were carried out against legitimate targets under international law for the use of precise munitions and on the basis of precise intelligence against two senior hamas officials but as you did mention there, reaction coming in from right around the world. We also heard from the U.N. palestinian refugee agency, unwra. It has posted on ""x"" that gaza is now hell on earth adding that they have lost contact with colleagues in the gaza strip. Let's take a listen to what we also heard from the e.u.'s foreign policy. Josef burrell. >> This is a dilemma how the international community can force implementation of the international justice. >> Natasha: there's something else we absolutely need to cover. This airstrike happened just hours after dispursed rocket attacks into central israel in months and the rockets were fired from rafah and hamas has claimed responsibility. That's a major development. Just bring us up to speed on that. >> Reporter: you're exactly right. It's caused a lot of shock here in tel aviv and central israel. It was four months since the last air raid sirens were activated. A barrage of missiles sent over from, as you mentioned there, from rafah into central israel, causing people to run to shelter. We can stel tell you that the iron dome missile defence system was activated and intercepted quite a large number of these rockets, although some did make it through. It was just a little further north of me that one of these rockets actually came and hit a house injuring one person that was then taken to hospital. So certainly this is something that hamas continues to do, fire rockets from rafah, really causing a lot of panic here in israel. >> Natasha: we've got two, three days of just absolutely devastating and destructive rocket fire going back and forth. What is all this doing for any possibility of ceasefires or talks of negotiations, hostage release, anything like that? >> Reporter: well, really it would appear to be diminishing the chances of any hostage and ceasefire talks. We do know that the israeli war cabinet met last night, although they are remaining very, very tight-lipped about what actually was discussed there. We've also heard the qataris coming out saying these strikes on rafah really affect the chances of any ceasefire and hostage deal being reached and while there is a lot of hope this may be achieved, not really a lot of optimism. >> Natasha: sarah coates in tel aviv, thank you.

>>> A jewish girls' school in toronto is welcoming back students today after shots were fired at the building over the weekend. Police say they're looking at multiple suspects and the hate crimes unit has opened up its own investigation. Cbc's marianne dimain is following this ier stochlt earlier today a solidarity rally did take place. The mayor and other officials were there. What can you tell us about that? >> Reporter: the message at this rally outside of the school in toronto this morning is that students should have the right to a safe learning environment and that's why dozens of people came out outside of the jewish girls' school. Some of them carrying flags, other signs. One of them said ""you are not alone."" what you're looking at now, scenes from the weekend and the damage to the school that happened on saturday morning. Police saying that armed suspects were at the school around 5 A.M. that's when shots were fired at the school before the suspects fled the scene. At this point, they have not found those suspects, but no one was injured in this case. The school was damaged, as you saw there in those images. The school community quite shaken up as a result of what happened there over the weekend and that's what prompted today's rally. The mayored was also there but also parents were quite concerned and here's more from one of those parents. >> Who are angry and shocked, angry that we have to explain to our girls why this is happening and shocked that, you know, it's gone this far. >> Reporter: toronto's police chief as well as the mayor of the city was also there this morning. Other communities were also speaking to the crowd of dozens of people standing there in the rain this morning and here's some of what was said. >> What happened here this weekend crossed a dangerous line. It was an attempt to intimidate and isolate the wonderful people, the wonderful children, here and it was a deliberate attempt to spread fear across our entire jewish community, to make us cower and hide who we are. As you can see here today, the attackers completely failed. We are more united than ever. We are more committed than ever to support each other. We are more determined than ever to fight antisemitism wherever it happens. >> We say to this coward, these cowards, we will find you. You will be held responsible. >> Reporter: toronto's guns and gangs unit as well as the hate crime unit are investigating. The suspect has not yet been found. >> Natasha: I want to let folks watching at home know that we have put in a request to speak to toronto mayor olivia chow about what's happened at the school and how things will move forward from there. So thank you for playing that clip, marianne. Let's talk about the school itself. What is it going to look like there today? >> Reporter: you know the school community banding together right now. They are standing together in solidarity. Its business as usual there. The principal spoke at this news conference as well as to reporters saying that there is a lot of attendance there. Not a lot of people have stayed home. They have pretty much a full house. Amid those classes today also a stepped up police presence. That will be the case for quite some time. Also some important conversations. Here's more on that. >> I have two groups of students who are splitting them in half. The younger students first and then the older students. And we are going to have those conversations. We'll discuss what happened. We're going to discuss moving forward, how we plan to continue doing what we're doing. >> Reporter: that stepped up police presence not just at the bais mushka but other area schools and area synagogues in the community as well. >> Natasha: cbc's marianne dimain dimain, thank you so much.

>>> In just under an hour's time, thousands of residents in fort nelson, british columbia, and fort nelson first nation will be allowed to return home. They've been on an evacuation order for more than two weeks when the parker lake wildfire got way too close. They're praying themselves for what they're see when they get back home. >> Out in the rural areas, they're going to see a lot of damage. Particularly out on the edges of community to the north and at the fire bird highway so it's blackened trees and there's some places where you can't go where you used to be able to go like the parker lake recreation area is blocked off just because of so many danger trees across the road. So there is some significant damage to the north and west of the community. You know, that's going to make them feel sad. >> Natasha: more than 4500 evacuees have been out of their homes since may the 10th. Some essential workers have been there over the past few days to get services up and running again. The mayor is telling people to fuel up and bring a few days' of essential supplies.

At Thunder Bay's favourite festival ""Wake the Giant"". Ta-da! There it is. The premier says the materials in the school were clearly inappropriate. What exactly is the issue? >> Reporter: it's hard to see and vey exactly what the premier is taking issue with, though we know that the premier blaine higgs posted on ""x,"" former twitter, he is furious about this picture, this photo of a presentation that was done at a new brunswick school that was shared with him and is shows questions on this slide where it has questions like, do girls masturbate? Will it hurt the first time I do it? Questions that might come up kind of organically during a sex ed conversation or sex ed class; however, this was being done and organized by the research and information group so acb global action, a group that tries to share information about sexual transmitted infections with students around the world and across canada and specifically this past week in a few schools in new brunswick. And so blaine higgs, the premier of new brunswick, saying that what they were talking about goes beyond the scope of what they were there to speak to the students about. Now, he put this in his post at the bottom of the post, there is a link to the pc party website where people can share their thoughts on if they are concerned about this, how much they are concerned about this, as well as an option to volunteer for the party. So perhaps some public sentiment assessment, perhaps a collection of public feedback happening here as well. >> Natasha: what are we hearing from this organization that offered the sex ed resource? >> Reporter: well, they're scratching their heads a bit too because they've done presentations like this for years in new brunswick schools. They have been prepared in four different new brunswick schools. The material or the topics they will be talking about is all within the curriculum, they say, of new brunswick and the materials specifically was approved, as is always, for them, they say, prior to the presentation beginning by the schools themselves. So they are surprised, disappointed, by this decision. As for more details, the cbc new brunswick colleagues are reaching out to the premier's office so far for more details. So far no answer to those requests. >> Natasha: brett ruskin in halifax, thank you.

I grabbed my dog. We headed for there and it just -- it was just unbelievable the sound of all the destruction going on around us. It's terrible. >> It's terrible. It's amazing the destruction and

the loss that has been experienced in this tornado. Not only here in valleyview but at the other locations here in north texas. >> Reporter: valleyview, texas, you heard that mentioned just before that area, that small town at least seven people died there.

And there are even some reports of some of these big rig trucks, natasha, these giant big rig trucks just blown over by all this. >> Natasha: the weather continues to be a threat. So what are we seeing in the forecast? >> Reporter: well, this storm is not over. It's moving east, though, so kentucky, these other states will not be impacted that much but it's moving east so the east coast is going to be hit. We don't know how severe the weather will be, but there are these severe weather watches throughout and up and down the east coast from new york to savannah, georgia, and we mentioned texas.

Indigo shareholders are voting on a deal that would put the company fully back in the hands of its founder and her husband. Scott peterson is following this story. The big question is why take the company private now? >> Reporter: a lot of analysts are asking this. There's a couple of it different answers. One the stock is flirting with lows that we haven't seen in four years. So it's a potentially good buying opportunity. And two, if you're the majority shareholder, maybe you want to buy those shares back before putting some real investment into the company. There's a couple of different things. Take a look at the stock price and get a sense of what's happening. The share is worth $8. Over $30 if you go back a few years. They're at $2.48, there about, because the offer now is for $2.50 for the shares that heather reisman and jared schwartz do not own. So the ownership structure here is kind of an interesting with indigo. For example, jared schwartz is the founder of onyx corp.

he owns 59% of the common shares of the company through holding companies. He is married to ceo heather reisman, who owns about 4.6 of indigo shares again through holding companies. So together, they make up about two-thirds of the company. Now, the offer for the shares, like I mentioned, at $2.50, and the vote is taking place this morning at 11 o'clock and it requires approval by two-thirds of the shareholders out there and the majority of the shareholders who are not involved with those holding companies. So a lot of analysts are saying that indigo is going through some tough times. They need some money to invest. They've fired people as recently as january and they took a $50 million fiscal loss last year, so the company is poised to have an influx of cash. Maybe we will see that after the restructuring and if it does go through and approved by the board, there will be -- it should delist the company as of june. They expect that to close soon. >> Natasha: the canadian stock market is open for business. It's memorial day down south. What should we be looking for? >> Reporter: look for markets to drive the sideways. We have the tsx up 50 points. Don't expect any volume or volatility without the big direction of U.S. neighbour. Let's take a look at some of the indicators s the price of oil flirting with $78 a barrel. We have the canadian dollar, the euro, british pound, all a little bit positive against its U.S. counterpart. I don't know if we get the tsx. It's up about 60 points right now.

Rescuers are digging with their bare hands or simple tools to reach the victims. Tons of debris buried the homes in the middle of the night when most of the villagers were asleep. Some parts of the village are under as much as 8 metres of debris. Officials warn that few of those will be saved because damaged roads mean rescuers can't get the heavy equipment they need into the disaster zone. Let's stick with this story. Mate begocher is with the united nations humanitarian. He is an adviser there. He's based in papa new guinea and joining us from wabeg. Thank you for making time for us. >> Reporter: thank you.

Pro-palestinian protesters, their joint by labour region, faculty and staff as a defiant trespass order to leave king's college circle and cp24 says it does get is live at u of t with the latest lindsay. >> Yeah, that rally wrapped up this morning. A car in the latest now is that the university says it's going to file an injunction to have these protesters removed from the encampment. And we do have a statement from the university released just last hour or so, every part of that for you now it says the notice of motion is proceeding normally and will be accessible through the usual process once it's filed off the court at 3.30 university avenue. We continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment and hope they will bring the unauthorized encampment to a peaceful and so the encampment here today, obviously, has not been dismantled yet. And students say they are not leaving bakari until the university has their 3 main demands. And we did hear from air maki who has become one of the spokes peers, people for the encampments. And she was talking a little bit more about the negotiations that are still continuing between the university and students. And also why students are staying here. Have a listen to what she had to say. My is being used to fund the development of weapons and bombs that are being dropped on the palestinian people. >> Which is why we're here, which is why, you know, we have no other choice but to continue these negotiations. And so, you know, the injunction was on pause until tomorrow. The court said that, yeah, they're going to postpone the hearing until tomorrow. So we'll have to kind of wait and see. But this evening at 5:00, we have another meeting with the administration to hopefully get them to commit to divestment. >> United will never be defeated. >> So if there is, as you potential for maybe a peaceful resolution, bakari, between the university and the students negotiations continue tonight, starting at 5:00. In the meantime, we're waiting to hear when that court date could be scheduled, usually after an injunction is filed. It's 24 to 48 hours afterwards. So could possibly be tomorrow or the day after that. The university has been wanting these protesters to dismantle their encampment over the last 25 days because they say it's causing some safety concerns for other students who are on campus who feel unsafe. But again, the protesters here say they have no plans to do until the university meets their demands preparing. Okay, continuing our coverage live from. >> King's college circle.

It's a whole different this is not close to home. This is I spent many hours here day and and it was pretty shocking. >> I'm here to stand with you to say that anti-semitism, it's like cancer. We have to say no. It erodes the boss of empathy and compassion between people. Is saying no to decay over so side into hate and out and absolutely have no place in toronto. >> Let me make this clear and I'm sure many of you agree, we will not be intimidated. We live in the city. We helped build this city and we plan to stay. >> People come to toronto from all over the world to escape conflict zones to escape hate. We don't want your vile hate here. We're a city of peace and respect. >> Communities then strong, we teach that everybody's there for each other and that's how we have to stand together unity in one and show that if you hurt one, you hurt us all. >> Archie was can be stronger united and we take care of each other and we know that we have many friends and allies are going to be here with us as well, who also take care of us and support us. But really, we're trying to send a wake-up call to all of toronto. What's

happening in our city is scary. It's unacceptable impacts real lives. There are children who are affected by this and we need all over all of our neighbours of all communities stand with us and say hate against any community, including the 2 has no place in the city. >> Well, police have said that it's too early to determine if the shooting as a hate crime or act of terrorism, but noted that the hate crime unit is supporting the investigation. Residents in some neighbourhoods, they've been told to expect an increased police presence. 35 20 degrees right now. Let's get early look at the roads this afternoon with traffic specialist adwoa nsiah-yeboah good afternoon been watching this long-standing problem through milton involving a collision involving a jackknifed transport truck. It looks like things are. >> Starting to slowly get better. That truck is completely out of the ditch about some good news. Unfortunately from westbound for one approaching highway. 25 still, hov lane continues to squeeze by and a bit of a delay on the approach. But the good news, we had some problems on the eastbound lanes of the 401. It was only approach to dixie actually past dixie in the express that collision. It did clear problems persist. So eastbound for one, as you make a way to scarborough to kennedy collision involving a truck does have the right lane and the on ramp from kennedy to the eastbound 4, 1, it's also occupied promise to deal with as well. This is on the northbound lanes of the don valley parkway lawrence collision still there in the left lane. And we're getting word of some flooding. This is on the niagara-bound lanes of the qew approaching here. Ontario until on scene blocking the right lane. The flooding is actually at the end of the on ramp from your ontario. So that's also adding to a very slow commute. A reminder eastbound 4, 1, at highway 6 north collision cleanup in the 2 right lanes. And if your travels that do take it to city streets. Crews on scene of a collision on the lakeshore and I'll send it back to you. Bakari. Thanks a lot. Toronto is launching a partnership that aims to address its transportation challenges. Split. >> Cutting edge technology. The city signed a memorandum of understanding with the ontario vehicle innovation network. It's going to provide eligible companies with up to $100,000 in funding to test traffic management act, which utilizes 5 eur connectivity along with artificial intelligence. The city says that the agreement supports the congestion management plan council adopted last year. Siemiatycki, professor of geography and planning as well as director of infrastructure and university of toronto joined cp24 live at noon was more on how this project could help with the city's traffic woes. >> There have been dreams going back decades that we have automated traffic lights, that it would be able to make sure that when you're coming to the light is always green for you. But keep in mind when it screened for us red for someone else and that's always been a challenge, perhaps with new ai technologies. They can get more efficient. We think we can squeeze more efficiency out of the network. But overall, we have too many cars for not enough road space. This will make some difference, but it's not going to transform the gridlock that we're experiencing today. >> The pilot project is going to start in the summer at some toronto's busiest intersections. City staff are expected to report back on some of the findings at the end of the year. Well, we are following a developing story this afternoon. Boy is dead after shooting in the east end police.

Peel regional police unveiling today result of a major auto theft investigation. We'll tell you more about project odyssey in moments. It is 4:00 24 degrees from 299 queen street west. This is toronto's breaking news cp24. Hello. I'm melissa duggan. Our top story right now. Pro-palestinian protesters, are joined by labour unions, faculty and staff as they defy a trespass order to leave king's college circle. Cp24's lindsay biscaia is at u of t with the latest and lindsay on a day where we've seen so much rain, any signs of protesters leaving. >> Not at all, melissa. But I mean, I would say not this morning. You know, we saw, as you say, so much rain, just absolutely pouring this morning. And it did not dampen the spirits of protesters. They have not started dismantling the encampment. You can see it in full force behind me. And more than that, they came out for a rally this morning to show solidarity for the people of palestine as well as people in this encampment. Despite all of that rain. So now as you mentioned, the latest is that the university is going to

file an injunction to have the protesters evicted from the university's property. But once you file an injunction takes 24 to 48 hours to schedule a court date. So we're still waiting to hear more on what the status is there. But we do have a statement from the university was issued to us a couple of hours ago, all read it for you. Now it says in part, the notice of motion is proceeding normally and will be accessible through the usual process once it is filed at the court at 3.30 university avenue. We continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment and hope they will bring the act unauthorized encampment to a peaceful. And the students here say that they have a couple demands 3 actually specific demands that they wanted the university to meet. So far, the university has not met those demands. And that is why they're not leaving. But we did also hear from a number of the encampment, one of the organizers today on that and and her thoughts on, you know, what's happening right now with the university and why they don't feel negotiations are going well, have a listen. >> My all of this, despite all the horrors and atrocities we're seeing every single day last 234 days, ut continues to tell us they cannot make commitments. And that we must go through a bureaucratic committees committees that will lead us nowhere. But we do not have time for committees. We do not have time to wait. >> So at this point, most important to note as well, negotiations between the university and students are continuing. This started last night at 5:00pm and we heard from erin mackey, she said that, you know, the demands were proposed again by the students and the school wanted to another day to look over the demands. And so those negotiations are going to continue tonight, starting at 5:00pm. So maybe there will be some kind of peaceful resolution here, but we're also waiting for that injunction to be filed as well. So we'll have to wait and see what happens. A lot of things still at play. But yes, as of today, this is day 25 and encampments remains here at u of t let's and a busy day for you. Lindsay developments coming in throughout the day. We'll check in with you a little bit later on. Thanks again. >> A university in montreal has been granted a partial injunction against pro-palestinian demonstrators, who set up an encampment of their own on its campus. A judge ruling today that safety measures need to be put in place that you quim encampment. Protestors have been banned from setting up tents within 2 metres of school buildings and they've also been ordered to keep doors and windows and walls clear of obstructions and allowed the fire department to inspect the site. The school argued the protesters posed a safety risk by blocking emergency exit and storing gas in the campus. There was a show of support today for a north york, a jewish girls school that was hit by gunfire over the weekend. Mayor olivia chow and police chief myron demkiw were among those who attended a solidarity rally this morning at the moose kellam entry school near dufferin and finch. Police responded to a call for shots fired at the school early saturday morning and found a bullet hole in the building. No one was hurt. Organizers, they say today's demonstration was meant to show the school students, staff and families that the community stands with them. >> I'm here to stand with you to say that anti-semitism, it's like cancer. We have to say no. It erodes the boss of empathy and compassion between people. Is saying no to decay over so side into hate and is out and absolutely have no place in toronto. >> Police have said it's too early to determine if the shooting is a hate crime or if it's an act of terrorism. But they note the hate crime unit is supporting this investigation. Residents in some neighbourhoods have been told to expect an increased police presence. It is 4:06. 24 degrees time for look at the so things over to adwoa. Well, yeah, has been a quite the a busy afternoon. Listen, if you are making your way out be putting on the brakes. >> On the northbound lanes of the 427, the do start just north of the gardiner in the collectors and they do continue all the way up towards dundas. That's because this collision that continues in the collectors that is blocking the 2 right lanes elsewhere are travelling on the eastbound 4, some good news. We have those in the renforth collision had 2 right lanes occupied coming tonight about problems of also cleared on the approach ontario. They were in the right lane, getting word of some new problems on the northbound 4 for the davis drive in newmarket crews that deal with the collision. It does have the left lane blocked on city

streets in the downtown core, a collision on a southbound abe at dundas. I'll send it back to melissa. Thanks for that. Welcome another developing story we're following closely for you today. A 16 year-old is dead after a shooting in the east end. >> Live now to cp24 crime and winless on the scene with the very latest. Steve, what do we know so far here? >> Mostly we know according to a toronto police to the latest homicide here in the sea happened just after 1:00 this morning. Cataraqui crescent is the location. It's the house behind me here we can have a look. It's near warden avenue in scarborough. Police say that they attended this location at 1:00 regarding a shooting. They arrived on scene, they found a young male, a 16 year-old who had been shot. He was rushed to a hospital life-threatening condition. And sadly, he died as a result of his injuries. So that homicide squad is now taking over this investigation. The forensics team has been on all day, several uniforms in the areas while canvassing the area looking for witnesses or anybody who has information pertaining to the shooting. The 6 year-old boy has been identified by police as jamal at U.S. 16 years old to from toronto. And we're not sure right now what the motive is, what the relationship is between the deceased and the suspect. In fact, we have no suspect information right now. I am expecting probably with an update once they get this investigation rolling, as time passes on, they will get more information pertaining to a suspect. And there is a lot of very good video surveillance around area as well. So I would suspect some point in time if the shooting happened inside. Inside the which has been reported. We might get the suspect leaving this location, but that will come in due course right now. The police continue to collect that information and they're looking for witnesses. So if you are in the area here on cataraqui near warden, 1:00 this spring or if you something that you thought to be suspicious, you're being asked to give the police a call. >> 16 years old to tragic story there. Thanks for that. Steve. >> Peel police say they have busted a highly orchestrated auto theft ring that they have dubbed project odyssey. >> Cp24's andrew brennan is here for more on this operation. Andrew, this sounds like a significant let's put it in numbers, melissa, over 33 million dollars in terms of the value of these recovered vehicles. 369 in all recovered either in the gta or all the way in montreal at the port of montreal known to be >> The major hub to get the stolen vehicles from across eastern canada out of the country. And also 16 people charged 322 charges laid that are from the criminal code. A lot some of the suspects that police have brought forward saying that they were already out on bail at the time. They were picked up 4 auto theft. Now when we have heard for not only from the lead detective today on what was as a part of project odyssey, but also from some of the mayors in the gta, particularly in brampton. A mississauga was heard from brampton's mayor patrick brown today, where it's been a noticeable problem. We've been seeing year-over-year increases in the number of not only violent carjackings, but auto thefts overall about this problem is one that is clearly not going away now. But this is a significant dent, it seems in organized crime trying to get these vehicles largely luxury vehicles out of the gta and on to ships out of the country. Take a listen. As a result of our investigation, we have recovered 369 vehicles. >> We seized 3 transport trucks and 2 stolen bobcats. What we're being facilitated at the yard and those items have been seized as offence related property. A total of 33.2 million dollars was recovered in stolen vehicles before it was destined out of the country. >> Auto theft crisis is a national crisis. It is the numbers are staggering. Across ontario and quebec record auto thefts. This has been the biggest gift organized crime in canadian history. 1.2 billion in 2022. The 23 numbers are coming in to maybe 2 billion to organized crime for international auto theft. But today's a bit of a the police did some great investigative work. We have the largest auto thefts commercial unit in canada in peel region and we arrest people in peel region. We take on difficult investigations and hold them accountable. So you can see on your screen now, some of the people that were picked up in charged by >> The crown following their arrests from peel regional police or partners.

There's also several people about 10 there are still outstanding and wanted for various charges, including auto thefts and there are some of them that are from toronto region. Others from the montreal region clearly indicating according to investigators, how much of a nefarious web this organized crime ring in scheme was and others still are to be broken up in the future.

We'll tell you more about to see what it led to police to discover. Stay with cp24. For more on these stories and for further details, you can visit our website cp24.com to international news. Now, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu says the strikes on rafah that killed dozens of civilians. They were a tragic mistake, adding that investigation is underway for the latest on the israel-hamas war. We're joined now by ctv's colton praill colton. What's the latest here? >> Well, it's it's a rare admission to hear from the israeli prime minister that this was not what they had intended. The idf has said previous intelligence that they had suggested that there would be no civilian harm from the strike at this encampment just outside of rafah. Instead, data from the gaza ministry of health says 45 people dead nearly 250 injured in those numbers may still climb. It's a stark contrast to what israel was expecting and to see the israeli prime minister stand up in his parliament and say that this was a mistake. This wasn't intended. Speaks to the amount of international pressure and domestic pressure that he is currently facing. We have seen the protests happening in jerusalem across israel from the families of those who families of the hostages. The immense pressure internally on benjamin netanyahu to free those. But we're also seeing in light of friday's decision from the international court of justice ordering all hopes to the offence in rafah. Much more international pressure specifically in the, in offence, in this area in relation to what we saw happen on sunday. The reason for the decision from the icj on friday were fears that any sort of military operation wouldn't be able to properly provide enough safety for the 800,000 plus civilians who were in rafah. This after about 800,000 people have already evacuated the area. And so to see this level of civilian casualties in the strike. One of the first significant strikes since that decision, it's led to immense international, a poor countries like spain floating the possibilities of possible sanctions on israel as a result of this. And the continued defiance of that icj order. We've heard from the un high commission are calling it a horrific attack. But it was an entirely predictable outcome, saying that there appears to be no change into the means or method of warfare

2024-05-30 18:51:16,"Higher education, media, and culture exchanges between China and Africa -- with implications for skills building, migration, and soft power -- are evolving as both regions settle into a post-pandemic normal. Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.
